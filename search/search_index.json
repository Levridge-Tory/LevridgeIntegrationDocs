This means there are two instances of the integration running to handle the entire integration. One aspect of Kahler that is different from other integrations is the D365 F&O to Kahler instance must run on premise because the Kahler system runs behind the firewall. This should be deployed as a service. Another aspect that is different is that each location should only get the messages from the topic that apply to that location. This is done with a filter on the service bus topic subscription. In order for the filter to work the Levridge Entity Event must be configured to expose the branch property on the message. Setup To integrate to and from Kahler and D365 F&O you will need to: Configure Event Endpoint in F&O Configure Levridge Entity Events You will need to be sure to provide properties on the event to allow filtering by Branch Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 F&O Create an Azure Active Directory Application in D365 F&O Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Orders (D365 F&O to Kahler) Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Records (Kahler to D365 F&O) Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Order topic for each Branch that has a Kahler mixer Create a filter on the subscription for each Branch Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Record topic for integration back to F&O Deploy the Levridge Integration Framework as a service at each Branch that has a Kahler mixer Configuration for Kahler on Premise This configuration will need to be on premise with the Kahler mixer. The on-premise instance will handle the Dispensing Work Order from D365 F&O to Kahler and the Webhook that receives Dispensing Work Records from Kahler. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"KahlerConroller\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\" }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Order\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Order service bus topic] \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"Kahler End Point\", //[section name with Kahler data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": [Application ID used to register the application in AD], \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": [Client Secret generated for the Application ID in AD], \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Kahler End Point\": { \"UriString\": [URL to Local Kahler] }, \"Dispensing Work Order\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Order Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Order Topic Name], \"SubscriptionName\": [Subscription Name for the Branch], \"RequiresSession\": true }, \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Record Topic Name], \"RequiresSession\": true } Controllers This section contains a list of controllers that will be loaded by the current instance. In addition to the default controller that we always want to load, we want the system to load the Kahler controller. The names (on the left) are not significant and are used only for debugging. The values (on the right) are significant. It must be the name of the assembly that should be loaded for the controller. SourceConfig The source config will represent the data being send from D365 F&O. Currently, the Dispensing Work Order is the only entity sent from F&O. In the future the topic may also include master data that is sent to Kahler. The ODataConfigName is not currently being used but is a required value. So point it to the section that contains the connection information to D365 F&O. TargetConfig The target config will represent the data endpoint for the local Kahler mixer. The \"ODataConfigName\" should point to a section that contains the Kahler REST endpoint. Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController This section is used by the Kahler controller to be able to send messages to the proper topic to be handled by the integration framework and written to D365 F&O Configuration for Kahler in Azure This instance can be a single instance running in the cloud.

This document provides and overview of the integration framework and links to the document that exists for the framework. Overview The Levridge Integration Framework is an entity syncronization framework. It provides a means to synchronize data at an entity level between multiple data sources. All integrations that use the framework follow the same pattern: 1. A data source has an integration event 2. The data source responds to the integration event by sending one or more entities to the service bus. 3. The service bus publishes the message(s) to each subscription 4. An instance of the integration framework receives the message(s) from a subscription 5. The integration framework transforms the message it if needed 6. The integration framework sends the message to the target data source Integrations Currently we support the following integrations: - D365 F&O to D365 CRM - D365 CRM to D365 F&O - Kahler - Agsync - oneWeigh - Field Reveal - Surety - Levridge Scale House D365 F&O to D365 CRM Setup To integrate from D365 F&O to D365 CRM you will need to: - configure Levridge Entity Events - Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 CRM - Create an application user in D365 CRM and assign the proper role(s) - Create an Azure Service bus topic - Create a subscription on the topic above Configuration In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": [section name with service bus topic], \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with F&O data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with CRM data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsCRM\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } D365 CRM to D365 F&O Setup To integrate from D365 CRM to D365 F&O you will need to: - Configure Azure Service Bus Endpoint in CRM - Configure Azure Service Bus plugin on the appropriate entities - Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 F&O - Create an Azure Active Directory Application in D365 F&O - Create an Azure Service bus topic - Create a subscription on the topic above Configuration In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": [section name with service bus topic], \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with CRM data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsCRM\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with F&O data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } Kahler The Kahler integration is a bidirectional integration that consists of a Topic for Dispensing Work Orders that go from D365 F&O to Kahler and Dispensing Work Records that go from Kahler to D365 F&O. This means there are two instances of the integration running to handle the entire integration. One aspect of Kahler that is different from other integrations is the D365 F&O to Kahler instance must run on premise because the Kahler system runs behind the firewall. This should be deployed as a service. Another aspect that is different is that each location should only get the messages from the topic that apply to that location. This is done with a filter on the service bus topic subscription. In order for the filter to work the Levridge Entity Event must be configured to expose the branch property on the message. Setup To integrate to and from Kahler and D365 F&O you will need to: - Configure Levridge Entity Events - You will need to be sure to provide properties on the event to allow filtering by Branch - Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 F&O - Create an Azure Active Directory Application in D365 F&O - Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Orders (D365 F&O to Kahler) - Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Records (Kahler to D365 F&O) - Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Order topic for each Branch that has a Kahler mixer - Create a filter on the subscription for each Branch - Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Record topic for integration back to F&O - Deploy the Levridge Integration Framework as a service at each Branch that has a Kahler mixer Configuration for Kahler on Premise This configuration will need to be on premise with the Kahler mixer. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"KahlerConroller\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\" }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Order\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Order service bus topic] \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"Kahler End Point\", //[section name with Kahler data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": [Application ID used to register the application in AD], \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": [Client Secret genrated for the Application ID in AD], \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Kahler End Point\": { \"UriString\": [URL to Local Kahler] }, \"Dispensing Work Order\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Order Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Order Topic Name], \"SubscriptionName\": [Subscription Name for the Branch], \"RequiresSession\": true }, \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Record Topic Name], \"RequiresSession\": true } Controllers This section contains a list of controllers that will be loaded by the current instance. In addition to the default controller that we alwasy want to load, we want the system to load the Kahler controller. The names (on the left) are not significant and are used only for debugging. The values (on the right) are significant. It must be the name of the assembly that should be loaded for the controller. SourceConfig The source config will represent the data being send from D365 F&O. Currently, the Dispensing Work Order is the only entity sent from F&O. In the future the topic may also include master data that is sent to Kahler. The ODataConfigName is not currently being used but is a required value. So point it to the section that contains the connection information to D365 F&O. TargetConfig The target config will represent the data endpoint for the local Kahler mixer. The \"ODataConfigName\" should point to a section that contains the Kahler REST endpoint. Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController This section is used by the Kahler controller to be able to send messages to the proper topic to be handled by the integration framework and written to D365 F&O Configuration for Kahler in Azure This instance can be a single instance runing in the cloud. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Record\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Record service bus topic] \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": [Application ID used to register the application in AD], \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": [Client Secret genrated for the Application ID in AD], \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Dispensing Work Record\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Record Topic Name], \"SubscriptionName\": [Subscription Name for Integration to D365 F&O], \"RequiresSession\": true } Agsync oneWeigh Field Reveal Surety Levridge Scale House","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"ReadMe (2)/#introduction","text":"The Levridge integration framework provides integration between Dynamics365 Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement and 3rd party applications.

It contains classes in the following categories: * Mapping Unit Test Helper Classes * Service Bus Helper and Mock classes * Integration Test Helper Classes Mapping Unit Test Helper Classes EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper The EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper class contains static methods you can use to obtain an EntityMapProvider<> for a particular scenario and methods to execute A2B and B2A synchronization using the EntityMapProvider<> obtained. To create a unit test that can test a mapping scenario, reference this library in your test project. Then create a unit test using the following steps: Call GetEntityMapProvider (Type entityMapBuilderType, string methodName) passing the source target template parameter types as defined on the mapping method along with the class that contains the mapping method and the name of the mapping method that you want to test. For example, to test the mapping for AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor and ScaleHouseEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor make the following call: var mapProvider = EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper.GetEntityMapProvider<AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor, ScaleHouseEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor>(typeof(AxToScaleEntityMapBuilderExtensions), \"MapAXScaleTicketGradeFactor_ScaleHouseScaleTicketGradeFactor\"); Instantiate and populate the entities you want to use for mapping. I prefer to use the [MemberData] attribute to provide multiple instances for testing. See this article for example on providing data for unit tests. Use the EntityMapProvider<> to perform the mapping by calling one of the transform methods on The EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper class. For example, to test the B2A mapping for the previous example use the following code: AXentity = EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper.TransformB2A(mapProvider, ScaleEntity, AXentity); Assert - check the mapped values In order to test the expected values you should have an instance of the target object with the expected values and then get the transformed object from the target entity and compare the two. You can pass in an object with the expected values using the MemberData method. Example: // Get target object var targetObject = AXentity.GetEntityAsDotNetType<AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor>(); // Assert Assert.NotNull(targetObject); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.GradeFactorId, targetObject.GradeFactorId); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.GradeFactorValue, targetObject.GradeFactorValue); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.TicketNumber, targetObject.TicketNumber); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.LineNumber, targetObject.LineNumber); Using MemberData to Provide Unit Test Data If you want to use the MemberData method for building data to use in your unit tests (you can refer to this article for an over view) here are some ideas. 1. Create Methods to Instantiate and Populate the Source and Expected Target Objects I would recommend creating a private static method on your test class that recieves parameters that can be used to initialize the class with the desired values. If you need several parameters you can put them in an object array or Key Value pair or even a dictionary. Example: private static AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(int line, string id, string value, string ticketNumber) { return new AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor() { LineNumber = line, GradeFactorId = id, GradeFactorValue = decimal.Parse(value), TicketNumber = ticketNumber }; } 2. Create Methods to Instantiate and Populate the Source and Target Entities Once you have a populated source object you can use it to instantiate and initialize a source Entity. Example: private static Entity GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor scaleTicketGradeFactor = null) { var axScaleTicketGradeFactor = scaleTicketGradeFactor ?? new AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor(); Entity entity = DynamicsAxEntities.Instance.GetScaleTicketGradeFactorEntity(); entity.CreateAndPopulateEntityFields(typeof(JSONField<>), axScaleTicketGradeFactor); return entity; } As you can see, if an object is provided, it is used to initialize the Entity. Otherwise a default object is used. 3. Implement the MemberData Method As described in this article for an over view) the MemberData method must return IEnumerable<object[]> . You can craete a method that uses the methods described in the previous steps to create source & target entities along with a target expected object. Then you can define that method using the [MemberData] attribute. Here is an example MemberData method: public static IEnumerable<object[]> GetSynchronizeA2BGradeFactorData() { return new List<object[]> { new object[] { GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(1, \"A\", \"8\", \"0000169\")), GetScaleHouseGradeFactorEntity(), GetScaleHouseTicketGradeFactorObject(1, \"A\", \"8\", \"0000169\") }, new object[] { GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(2, \"AB\", \"0.3\", \"0000169\")), GetScaleHouseGradeFactorEntity(), GetScaleHouseTicketGradeFactorObject(2, \"AB\", \"0.3\", \"0000169\") }, new object[] { GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(3, \"AS\", \"31.3\", \"0000169\")), GetScaleHouseGradeFactorEntity(), GetScaleHouseTicketGradeFactorObject(3, \"AS\", \"31.3\", \"0000169\") } }; } Example Unit Test Here is an example unit test that tests Ticket Grade Factor entities from the ScaleHouse application to F&O.
