Fertilizer Calculator - utility that allows a salesperson to determine and calculate fertilizer requirements such as what product best fits the need of the customer and how much of that product is needed to fulfill the order (some work order is still needed and is anticipated to be ready in Fall 2020). Sales Order Process - integration of all Levridge pieces, specifically split billing, and its close integration with sales orders in F&O. Process #1: Planned to Sales Agreement There are three separate methods of kicking off a planned sales agreement with CE: 1. Batch plans 2. Regular plans 3. Proposals Batch Plans Bath Plans tab Generate new Populate required fields Name: this field will auto populate when you click save Proposal Type: there are three proposal types: Customer, Field, Prospect. The batch plan will autopopulate to the Customer Type. Customer Operation Split Group Sales Period: Needed to accurately price Save Programs tab Farmable acreage field is required Preconfigured set of products in many cases on agronomist recommends the same products at the same time so instead of calculating these rates each time, you can set up a program, so it automatically calculates product and rate. Add products utilizing hte tabs across the top of the batch plan (seed, fertilizer, chemical, etc.) After adding your products, you can either: Generate a proposal Generate a sales agreement Proposal Types There are three different proposal types within a batch plan: Customer, Prospect, and Field. 1. Customer: Simplest proposal type and is the most used proposal type for a batch plan 2. Prospect: Individual the salesperson is pursuing that is not a current client and would like to generate a price for product and contract. - Generate contract - Sales period - Farmable Acreage approximation - Navigate to the seed, fertilizer, or chemical tab(s) to add product - Create proposal - Open proposal - Proposal lines tab - Run report - Print proposal - Give to potential client 3. Field: Least common proposal type used - Only benefit of the field is if we go through and make individual plans - You can add products once to all applicable fields Creating a Regular Plan Plan to sales agreement Plans Generate new plan record Populate applicable fields Account Customer Operation Customer Site: Physical piece of land that you are putting product on Split group Description: Multiple plans for a field may be created so a detailed description is important Desired Crop Growing Season: The year the product will be applied to the field Utilize the tabs (Programs and Reccomendations, seed, fertilizer, or chemical) to add applicable product(s) Programs and Recommendations: Programs: Ability to add existing or new programs Recommendations: Attachment to precision mapping tools Seed (unit): Seed calculator: Helps to easily populate the quantity field Add product line(s) for all required seed Fertilizer: Timing: When to apply product Product Rate Unit/Rate This calculation not only helps get the product pricing but also helps to know when the grower needs specific products applied. Chemical: Timing: When to apply product Product Rate Unit/Rate This calculation not only helps get the product pricing but also helps to know when the grower needs specific products applied. Plan is complete and proposal can be generated New Proposal Plan to sales agreement Proposals Generate new proposal Populate applicable fields Description Amount Customer Operation Split Group Growing Season Sales Period Manager: the client will have a workflow that sets who the Manager is so it is auto-generated. This is a customization. Associated plans Add existing plans Select all associated plans created for this specific grower Add Create lines This function goes through each plan taking all product information and the split groups behind them and generates individual product lines for them and creates pricing. Item category terms Allow syou to set different payment methods by product. Select item category (product) select payment method Save Proposal lines Discounts/incentives to support with proposal price Launch line you would like to discount Charge codes Add new proposal line change Select charge code: Charge codes are user defined data that are defined in F&O/AX and are integrated over to CE Value: dollar amount to be deducated off total product price Save Refresh Proposal line will be updated to reflect new unit price after charge code has been applied. Unit price: You can manually override this field to decrease price as well. Calculate prices Add product lines from proposal lines tab In some instances, a customer will decide to add products after you have generated the proposal. Using the add new proposal line within the proposal lines tab will allow you to add last minute products to the proposal and recalculate price. 1. (+) New proposal line 2. Select product 3. Quantity 4. save 5. Calculate prices 6. Line will be added to the proposal lines toab and price will be updated for that product from data from F&O/AX. Submit for Approval Once your proposal is priced and complete, it is ready to be submitted for approval. The submit for approval function/button ensures that margin on products are maintained throughout the sales process. 1. Submit for approval - Looks for any charge code or line item changes that were made and compares them to the defined thresholds that have been set. - If any changes rise above threshold set it will stop the process, lock down proposal, and send to the Manager that the proposal needs approval before moving forward to contract/agreement - Seed: - Patented traits owned by specific manufacturer that you must have a license from before you can purchase and use product - The system will look and see if grower has avalid agreement to buy this product and if there is configuration fin F&O/AX to either warn or stop theprocess. - With seed, you will typically use the \"warn\" function instead of full stopping the process. - Restricted used pesticides: - Based on federal and state laws, before restricted products can be picked up, we must ensure the applicator has a valid license to apply the product. This license number needs to be physically listed on the invoice. This will warn the process this item needs to be reviewed. - At this point in the process, it is important to check back in unti lthe license number has been documented. 2. Generate sales agreement - The sales agreement will be sent to F&O/AX once generated. - The process is then complete within CE. - The final step in the sales process would be to pull up the third-party integration (ex: Hello Sign) to capture a digital signature. Process #2 Fertilizer Calculator The Fertilizer Calculator is a tool used to generate blends of fertility products. 1. Planning Tools 2. Fertilizer Calculator 3. Generate New 4. Populate applicable fields - Customer - Customer Operation - Batch size: Blender capacity when generated relays how many batches will need to occur to fill order. - Fertilizer State - Dry - Liquid Save Blend lines will populate with nutrient and product Input either input value (lbs.) or ratio (percentage) Click Calculate to populate output Quantity needed Total blend amount Number of batches needed Blend percent Generate sales order and release report to blender facilities to begin blending product (this function is not currently available but will be once it is fully developed and tested.) Process #3 Sales Order Process The sales order is comprised of two pieces: the sales order and the work order. Both are tightly integrated within FinOps. The purpose of the sales order is to give users that only have access to CE the ability to enter orders for delivery and perform some of the functions that are usually completed in FinOps/AX. Generating New Sales Order in CE Sales order tab Generate new Populate applicable sales order fields Account Customer Operation: It will default to one if the customer only has one operation. Split group: The individual paying for the product Delivery address: A requirement for many of the actions in F&O Inventory site: Where the inventory is arriving from Branch: Who is responsible for the customer or in charge of handling the billing Sales period: Used to price products against Ship date: Will default if not manually if not populated. Not a requirement. Save Enter Sales Order Lines Add product Pick quantity Save After saving the estimated price, which is pulled from CE, will be populated. This may not be the price that is actually paid but is a stored list price that adjustments can be made to. Submit for Approval Checks for any products that need an applicator license Checks for any seed tech licenses that may be required Credit check ( based off the credit settings with F&O. It will either warn or deny a generating sales order. ) Generate Sales Order Once your submission has been approved, you will need to generate a sales order in F&O. You will receive a pop-up notifying you the sales order was created successfully in F&O/AX. Once order is acted upon in F&O, you can go into details within CE and will provide more information on the split group allocations so the person in CE has access to details. Work Order The work order is a type of sales order where the Ag Retailer will be performing a service. A work order requires more detail than a basic sales order. 1. Orders 2. Work Orders 3. Generate new 4. Populate applicable fields - Account - Customer Operation - Customer Site - Auto Print: Printer logic exists to automatically print a report remotely. Would be needed when a hard copy is necessary for the remote location to send with the driver. - Sales site: Party who is responsible for the sale of the product. - Application Site: Paraty performing task - Application Operation: Type of work beign done (synced with AgSync). - Application Date: Anticipated application date of the product - Application Window: For chemical product this is important because depending on stage of the crop, it could cause harm if applied outside a specific timeframe. - Crop: Crop the product will be applied to - Order Status: - Planned: Occurring in the future - Booked: Occurring in the future - Released: Moved to queue to get done and application date is set - Scheduled: Has been assigned to an applicator for a scheduled date - In-Progress: Product was administered partially and due to an unforeseen event, the job was not completed and requires further attention. - Completed Pending Review: Applicatoin is complete. - Archived - Rejected - Work Order ID: Generated number out of AgSync - Dispensing Order Number: Only comes into effect if there is a blender/Kahler integration. This number is created when the picking list/mixed ticket is dispatched out to the warehouse. - Ordering Notes: - Notes that are specific to the field - Notes that are specific to the application - Application Notes: Notes or observations the equipment operator made while in the field. - Save Enter Work Order Lines Work Order Lines tab Add new line Populate applicable fields Sales Sites Customer Product Pests: Certain states require documentation that states the application and purpose of the sprayed chemical. Application Site Quantity Submit for Approval If this is an integrated order from AgSync or a third-party dispatch, the submit for approval function would not be present. The \"Submit for Proposal\" would show up if generated in CE. If you open a work order line, you will be able to view the Work Order Completion tab which provides more information on the application and applicator.

AgSync is used by ag retailers to dispatch applicators and their equipment to different fields. More specifically, within AgSync agronomists can schedule out the days for applicators and their equipment pointing them to field A, then B, then C based on the location of the fields and the machinery and products the applicator takes with them. Levridge has built an integration between D365 finance and AgSync to connect the systems together. Within the integration, there are multiple types of data moving both ways. Master data moves from D365 to AgSync telling AgSync what customers, fields and products the ag retailer has. AgSync uses work orders to schedule the work on specific fields. Once created, work orders are sent from AgSync to D365 as sales orders. It is a bidirectional integration that consists of a Topic for Master Data that goes from D365 F&O to AgSync and Work Orders that go from AgSync to D365 F&O. The Work Order integration utilize a background service running in the same application as the Webhook controller so there is no need for two integration application instances. There are a few unique aspects to the AgSync integration that is different from other integrations: - The Workorder integration service runs in the same app service as the controller and the Master Data integration service. - The Workorder integration service does all the transformation directly rather than using an EntityMapper. - The Workorder integration service makes a direct service call to D365 F&O rather than using a data source. - We are using CDS to provide lookup services for mapping entity identifiers between systems. - We utilize a filter on the event in F&O to send only the customers that need to to be sent from F&O to AgSync. This document will provide an overview of the integration framework used to move the data and then it will describe the data moving within the integration. Let's start with the technology behind the integration. Integration Description Levridge's Integration Framework can be viewed in Integration Overview . Standard Master Data Integration The standard master data integration configuration is shown below. External UUID Master Data Integration There is an alternate configuration that may be required when integrating with Field Reveal when Field Reveal is the master source for customer fields. In this scenario Field Reveal will provide the UUIDs it generates so we can provide those values to Agsync when we create the corresponding records in Agsync. This scenario is complicated and should be avoided if possible. The reason it is necessary is because when Field Reveal creates a work order in Agsync directly it uses an old Agsync API that uses a UUID as the Sync ID. Field Reveal generates the UUID and needs to provide those to Levridge so they can be used when creating the master record in Agsync. In this scenario, it is imperative that the Customer and Customer Operation is not sent from F&O until they have been updated in Field Reveal and a Field created in Field Reveal. Once a record is created in Agsync the UUID for it cannot be modified. The order of creation is as follows: 1. Customer and Customer Operation are created in FinOps. 2. Grower and Farm are created in Field Reveal and SyncIds are added in Field Reveal. 3. Field is created in Field Reveal. 1. This will cause a Field record to be sent from Field Reveal to the Levridge Field controller . 2. The Field data will be placed on a service bus topic that has two subscriptions: 1. One subscription will be serviced by the FieldToCDS integration service. 1. This will use the UUID information to create a lookup record in CDS. 2. The other subscription will be serviced by the FieldToAX integration service 1. This will create the Customer Site in FinOps. 3. When the record is created in FinOps it will trigger the event that sends the data to Agsync. 1. The creation of the Customer Site entity causes the event to be evaluated. 2. The filter that checks to make sure a Customer has an operation that has a site that corresponds to a field passes. 4. The Customer, Operation and Site are all sent to the FinOpsToAgsync service bus topic. 5. The AxToAgsync integration service receives the message and looks up the UUIDs from CDS then sends the records to Agsync for creation. 6. Agsync creates the records and sends back a GUID. 7. The AxToAgsync integration updates CDS with the GUID values. This communication diagram depicts this interaction: Common Data Service (CDS) The Common Data Service (CDS) is a solution from Microsoft built on top of the Power Platform. CDS tables are used in the integrations between D365 and AgSync to translate values that are different between the 2 systems. For example, in AgSync, customers have unique identifiers called GUIDs. These values are different from the unique identifiers D365 has for the same customer accounts. Levridge has implemented new tables in CDS to translate the D365 Customer account to the AgSync GUID. For the CDS environment there are two purchasing options: 1. If the ag retailer has an existing CE instance, use it. A portion of the CE instance can be firewalled off for security purposes and then it can be used to host the CDS solution. 2. Buy a specific CDS environment for only the CDS solution. This is more expensive. There are 7 types of data stored in CDS: 1. Dispatch Accounts 2. Customers 3. Customer Operations 4. Customer Sites 5. Customer Site Locations 6. Master Items 7. Workers All these types are stored differently in AgSync than they are in D365 so they must be translated using the data in CDS. Products and Employees must be manually entered into the CDS database while Dispatch Accounts, Customers, Customer Operations Customer Sites and Customer Site Locations can be populated using a script that queries the data in AgSync and populates the data in CDS. All this data must exist in CDS prior to using the work order integrations. The Master Item entity translates AgSync operations to D365 Product and Service Items. This states which task you are performing and included in every work order. - Product ID Numbers (this relates to the Master item in D365). AgSync has the ability to generate blends (ex: blending multiple ingredients to produce the fertilizer to be used on a field). There is a Master Item Table in CDS configured specifically for the operation. If there is a blend flag on an order change, it will pull from the Master Item Table. The Worker Table is a translation table required to map the applicator (worker) set up in AgSync to D365. This provides the information of who applied the product to the field and their applicator license number. An applicator license number is required on the sales order. Three entities need to be manually entered in CDS. The CDS setup includes: - CE Levridge - AgSync Solution - Choose appropriate UI Form Once the CDS solution is deployed to an environment, an Application User will need to be created. Work Order Integration Below is the process to generate a work order in AgSync: - Select Customer - State where the application or service location will be completed out of - Include what work is being done - State the work order status (planned or released) - Planned: These are premade orders ready for a certain time. The action is not ready to be performed. Not all users can view planned status due to security measures in place (ex: dispatcher unable to see planned work status). - Released: The work orders are released and assigned to complete field work. - The work order comes to F&O regardless of status. - State the performed operation - State the products being utilized - Indicate the impacted crop(s) - Add in any additional notes - Save Order After a work order is saved, AgSync calls the Levridge AgsyncOrderChanged webhook sending over the work order data. The Levridge AgsyncOrderChanged webhook transforms the work order data and sends it to F&O where it creates or updates a corresponding sales order. If F&O accounts receivables are configured to perform a credit check and the credit check fails, F&O will send back a response indicating that the credit check did not pass. Then a rejection request is sent to Agsync to mark the work order as rejected. When F&O receives an updated work order from Agsync, F&O will remove all existing sales order line(s) and create new sale order line(s) to match the Agsync updated work order. This is done to keep the F&O sale order in sync with the possible changes that came through with Agsync updated work order. If a F&O sale's order has an active dispensing work order associated to it, then F&O will not delete or create new sales order line(s). An important item to note: A business process needs to be in place in the situation if AgSync creates a scheduled work order which gets scheduled, and then a dispensing work order is created and gets sent to Kahler. F&O will not pick up new changes if AgSync tries to go back to a release status and make changes and try to reschedule it. AgSync needs to cancel the Kahler order and F&O dispensing order and reschedule their AgSync work order. Microsoft Azure App Service The Levridge Integration Framework has been written as a web application that hosts HTTP endpoints as REST APIs and background processes that handle integrations. It is most commonly run in the cloud as an Azure App Serivce. It can also run as a windows service or as an IIS application. The Integration Overview provides additional information about the deployment options. Most of the setup will occur in Azure App Service. This is a requirement for AgSync in which AgSync pulls from Levridge's Azure Service Bus and an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications. Azure hosts our web app integration. The steps needed to create an App Service can be found under the Integration Overview . After the App ID has been generated along with the deployed integration code to App Service , there is an application configuration file named [appsettings.json])./appsettings.json.md). This file is located within the generated Azure Service. In the App Services portion of the Azure Portal there is a Kudos button on the left-hand side, with a function to ZipDeploy code . This is where one would deploy the integration code. After deployed, back in Azure Service and right below Kudos button, there is an App Service Editor where one would deploy the App Settings json file to, which will give a list of all the files part of the integration. One of those is called AppSettings.json where the configuration is made for the Azure Service. Configuration Set up the logging level . The next section to be configured would outline what direction information is flowing within the service itself. There is a target configuration and source configuration which is needed to specify: Which system is the source system and which system is the target system. Which configuration section contains data connection information. Which section contains the service bus configuration to use. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the InstanceConfig SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"InstanceConfig\": { \"AzureTableConfiguration\": \"[section name to Azure Table Configuration\", \"LogRequestsAndResponses\": [true or false] \"EnableAppInsightsAdaptiveSampling\": [true or false] }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"[section name with service bus topic and subscription for Agsync Master Data]\", \"ODataConfigName\": \"[section name with F&O data configuration]\", \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAx\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"[section name with Agsync endpoint configuration]\", \"CDSConfigName\": \"[section name with CDS data configuration]\", \"SystemName\": \"AgSync\", \"Direction\": \"Target\", } You must also include the controller entry to have the controller loaded: \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"AgSyncConroller\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.AgSyncController\" } You must also configure two objects for Agsync integration: AgSyncEndpoint agsync Here is a sample template for the entire appsettings.json file used for the integration from FinOps to Agsync: { \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"AgSyncConroller\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.AgSyncController\" }, \"Logging\": { \"Debug\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"Console\": { \"IncludeScopes\": true, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\", \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"AgsyncMasterDataServiceBus\", \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAx\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"AgSyncEndpoint\", \"SystemName\": \"AgSync\", \"Direction\": \"Target\", \"CDSConfigName\": \"CDS\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]\", \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]\", \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": \"[Application ID used to register the application in AD]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": \"[Client Secret generated for the Application ID in AD]\", \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"CDS\": { \"UriString\": \"[URL to CDS or Localhost]\", \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": \"[URL to CDS]\", \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": \"[Application ID used to register the application in AD]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": \"[Client Secret generated for the Application ID in AD]\", \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to CDS]/api/data/v9.0/\", \"AssemblyName\": \"Levridge.ODataDataSources.CDS\", \"ClientClassesNameSpace\": \"Levridge.ODataDataSources.CDS\", \"MetadataResource\": \"CDSMetadata.xml\" }, \"AgSyncEndpoint\": { \"MustUseWktProcessor\": true, \"baseUri\": \"https://fields.agsync.com/api/\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://auth.agsync.com/core/connect/token\", \"ClientId\": \"[client ID assigned by Agsync]\", // customer specific \"ClientPass\": \"[Client Secret assigned by Agsync]\", // customer specific \"ValutURL\": \"[URL to customer Azure Key Vault]\", \"AgSyncTokenKey\": \"AgsyncAccessToken\", \"RedirectUri\": \"[URL to AgsyncAuth controller]\", // customer specific \"IntegrationId\": \"CustomerIntegrationID\" // customer specific }, \"agsync\": { // used by Webhook \"MustUseWktProcessor\": true, \"ConnectionString\": \"[connection string to Agsync master data topic]\", \"TopicName\": \"[Agsync master data topic]\", \"RequiresSession\": true, \"RedirectUri\": \"[URL to AgsyncAuth controller]\", \"TokenUrl\": \"https://auth.agsync.com/core/connect/token\", \"AuthorizeUrl\": \"https://auth.agsync.com/core/connect/authorize\", \"baseUri\": \"https://fields.agsync.com/api/\", \"ClientId\": \"[client ID assigned by Agsync]\", \"ClientPass\": \"[Client Secret assigned by Agsync]\", \"ValutURL\": \"[URL to customer Azure Key Vault]\", \"AgSyncTokenKey\": \"AgsyncAccessToken\" }, \"AgsyncMasterDataServiceBus\": { \"ConnectionString\": \"[connection string to Agsync master data topic]\", \"TopicName\": \"[Agsync master data topic]\", \"SubscriptionName\": \"[Agsync master data subscription name]\", \"RequiresSession\": true } } Microsoft Azure Service Bus Microsoft Azure Service Bus is a message bus for businesses to exchange documents and messages in the Cloud. There are two main tiers: - Standard Service Bus: Supports 250 Kilobytes of data - Premium Service Bus: Supports 1 Megabyte of data Most Levridge clients will be able to utilize the Standard Service Bus tier, however, if a client is integrating well-known-text (WKT) files with their work orders it may push the workorder size over the 250K data limit and they should look at upgrading to Premium Service Bus. Microsoft outlines how to create an Azure Service bus . The Azure Key Vault is a tool for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. The vault enables us to securely store passwords, certificates, etc. with secure access. The key vault stores the authorization credentials for AgSync and by providing the secret to AgSync it lets AgSync know it is Levridge talking to them. This is required for all AgSync integrations. One can read how to setup the Azure Key Vault . When customer entities are sent from D365 to the Azure service bus, the agsync integration queries CDS to find the stored Customer ID. If there is no matching customer record the record is sent as a Create to AgSync. The customer is created in AgSync and the response from Agsync contains the Agsync specific ID for that customer. The newly generated AgSync ID is saved in combination with the D365 customer account in CDS. If CDS did have an existing record for the D365 customer, the message is updated to include the Agsync ID for that customer and the messages is sent to Agsync as an Update. Once a sales order is created in F&O, we will message back to AgSync and update them with the sales order number and the dispensing work order number (if available at the time of creation). This requires an entity setup in the event framework. Integration purchase requirements include: 1. CDS Instance - CE License 2. Azure Subscription - Service Bus - App Service - Key Vault 3. AgSync Subscription Setup Internal setup time for configuration is 24 hours. To integrate from D365 F&O to Agsync you will need to: Create an Azure Service bus topic Create a subscription on the topic above Configure Event Endpoint in F&O Configure Levridge Entity Events Create Filter on Entity Event to only send agronomy customers Get Client ID and CLient password from Agsync Get Customer Specific Integration ID from Agsync Client Redirect URL is [Azure Webapp base URL]/api/AgsyncAuth Setup Azure Keyvault Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 CE Create an application user in D365 CRM and assign the proper role(s) A webhook is an API provided by the Levridge Integration Framework that gives AgSync the ability to send workorders to Levridge. AgSync sends workorders to the Levridge API which places the order on the service bus. The customer's specific URL needs to be whitelisted by AgSync. To whitelist a URL, one would log into AgSync and create a helpdesk ticket requesting AgSync to add the AgsyncOrderChanged URL into their setup file. The expected service time is between 24-48 hours. Escalate after 48 hours. General setup timelines: - Deploying code to App Service takes the longest. 400 table lines for all three. - The worker table is refreshed once a quarter - Service item data is refreshed once a year - Master item data is refreshed once every three year Data Moving Within the Integration: There are 4 types of master records sent from D365 to AgSync: 1. Customers 2. Customer Operations 3. Customer Sites 4. LevAgSyncSalesDetailEntity - The LevAgSyncSalesDetailEntity stores sales, order number, dispensing work order numbers, and a unique work order ID that identifies the AgSync work order that needs to update. A Dispensing Account ID field has been added in F&O on the customer account under the sales order tab. Its purpose is to indicate which dispensing branch the customer receives services from. The dispensing branch within AgSync can be set up as either: - An inventory site indicating where the product is physically located - Commission/Sales groups indicating the agronomist that sold the service to the customer (Confirm and clarify this statement) Integration Framework Setup for Sending Customers \"Out of the Box Customer V3\" is being utilized and the code in the integration is choosing the data fields the entities pass through. The Dispatching Account ID is included on the customer form to only send accounts that have a dispatching account tied to it to AgSync. This is filtered by the Event Framework V3 Entity. An example is a client might have 100K in their database but for work order purposes there are only 30K that will ever work with AgSync. Filtering is again used in the Event Framework V3 Entity in the Customer Operation. This is a more sophisticated filter due to multiple types of operations an individual customer could have. Customer Operation is setup by four different filters: 1. Customer Operation Type 2. A filter is added so customer information which do not have a site is not sent. - Example: Customer operations will not be sent to AgSync if they do not have sites tied to them. 3. Customer Site Types 4. Dispensing Site ID Release Status Process A work order is created at release status. Take release in AgSync and schedule work order. (Scheduling is assigning it out to an applicator to be applied). Dispatcher is going to see all released orders. Dispatcher takes orders, creates task packet, assigns to worker, annotates which piece of application equipment is going to be running, and saves as scheduled packet. The message is once again generated to webhook in F&O. Status is updated to \"scheduled\" if a blend. This creates an automatically explode bomb at scheduled date. (ex: if a client is using automatic fertilizer, dispensing ticket is released at the scheduled state which kicks off another integration to Kahler, so they can blend and send product out to field that is going to be applied.)

Agsync Order Changed Controller The AgsyncOrderChanged controller is used by Agsync to send work orders as they are created or updated.

This is done during go-live to populate the lookup data in CDS. Agsync UUID Controller The AgsyncUUID controller provides UUIDs based on Sync Ids passed to the controller. This is used by Field Reveal to obtain the UUID from the Sync ID entered into Field Reveal.","title":"Agsync"},{"location":"Agsync/#agsync","text":"AgSync is a dispatching application owned by Raven Industries. AgSync is used by ag retailers to dispatch applicators and their equipment to different fields. More specifically, within AgSync agronomists can schedule out the days for applicators and their equipment pointing them to field A, then B, then C based on the location of the fields and the machinery and products the applicator takes with them. Levridge has built an integration between D365 finance and AgSync to connect the systems together. Within the integration, there are multiple types of data moving both ways. Master data moves from D365 to AgSync telling AgSync what customers, fields and products the ag retailer has. AgSync uses work orders to schedule the work on specific fields. Once created, work orders are sent from AgSync to D365 as sales orders. It is a bidirectional integration that consists of a Topic for Master Data that goes from D365 F&O to AgSync and Work Orders that go from AgSync to D365 F&O. The Work Order integration utilize a background service running in the same application as the Webhook controller so there is no need for two integration application instances. There are a few unique aspects to the AgSync integration that is different from other integrations: - The Workorder integration service runs in the same app service as the controller and the Master Data integration service. - The Workorder integration service does all the transformation directly rather than using an EntityMapper. - The Workorder integration service makes a direct service call to D365 F&O rather than using a data source. - We are using CDS to provide lookup services for mapping entity identifiers between systems. - We utilize a filter on the event in F&O to send only the customers that need to to be sent from F&O to AgSync. This document will provide an overview of the integration framework used to move the data and then it will describe the data moving within the integration. Let's start with the technology behind the integration.","title":"Agsync"},{"location":"Agsync/#integration-description","text":"Levridge's Integration Framework can be viewed in Integration Overview .","title":"Integration Description"},{"location":"Agsync/#standard-master-data-integration","text":"The standard master data integration configuration is shown below.","title":"Standard Master Data Integration"},{"location":"Agsync/#external-uuid-master-data-integration","text":"There is an alternate configuration that may be required when integrating with Field Reveal when Field Reveal is the master source for customer fields. In this scenario Field Reveal will provide the UUIDs it generates so we can provide those values to Agsync when we create the corresponding records in Agsync. This scenario is complicated and should be avoided if possible. The reason it is necessary is because when Field Reveal creates a work order in Agsync directly it uses an old Agsync API that uses a UUID as the Sync ID. Field Reveal generates the UUID and needs to provide those to Levridge so they can be used when creating the master record in Agsync. In this scenario, it is imperative that the Customer and Customer Operation is not sent from F&O until they have been updated in Field Reveal and a Field created in Field Reveal. Once a record is created in Agsync the UUID for it cannot be modified. The order of creation is as follows: 1. Customer and Customer Operation are created in FinOps. 2. Grower and Farm are created in Field Reveal and SyncIds are added in Field Reveal. 3. Field is created in Field Reveal. 1. This will cause a Field record to be sent from Field Reveal to the Levridge Field controller . 2. The Field data will be placed on a service bus topic that has two subscriptions: 1. One subscription will be serviced by the FieldToCDS integration service. 1. This will use the UUID information to create a lookup record in CDS. 2. The other subscription will be serviced by the FieldToAX integration service 1. This will create the Customer Site in FinOps. 3. When the record is created in FinOps it will trigger the event that sends the data to Agsync. 1. The creation of the Customer Site entity causes the event to be evaluated. 2. The filter that checks to make sure a Customer has an operation that has a site that corresponds to a field passes. 4. The Customer, Operation and Site are all sent to the FinOpsToAgsync service bus topic. 5. The AxToAgsync integration service receives the message and looks up the UUIDs from CDS then sends the records to Agsync for creation. 6. Agsync creates the records and sends back a GUID. 7. The AxToAgsync integration updates CDS with the GUID values. This communication diagram depicts this interaction:","title":"External UUID Master Data Integration"},{"location":"Agsync/#common-data-service-cds","text":"The Common Data Service (CDS) is a solution from Microsoft built on top of the Power Platform. CDS tables are used in the integrations between D365 and AgSync to translate values that are different between the 2 systems. For example, in AgSync, customers have unique identifiers called GUIDs. These values are different from the unique identifiers D365 has for the same customer accounts. Levridge has implemented new tables in CDS to translate the D365 Customer account to the AgSync GUID. For the CDS environment there are two purchasing options: 1. If the ag retailer has an existing CE instance, use it. A portion of the CE instance can be firewalled off for security purposes and then it can be used to host the CDS solution. 2. Buy a specific CDS environment for only the CDS solution. This is more expensive. There are 7 types of data stored in CDS: 1. Dispatch Accounts 2. Customers 3. Customer Operations 4. Customer Sites 5. Customer Site Locations 6. Master Items 7. Workers All these types are stored differently in AgSync than they are in D365 so they must be translated using the data in CDS. Products and Employees must be manually entered into the CDS database while Dispatch Accounts, Customers, Customer Operations Customer Sites and Customer Site Locations can be populated using a script that queries the data in AgSync and populates the data in CDS. All this data must exist in CDS prior to using the work order integrations. The Master Item entity translates AgSync operations to D365 Product and Service Items. This states which task you are performing and included in every work order. - Product ID Numbers (this relates to the Master item in D365). AgSync has the ability to generate blends (ex: blending multiple ingredients to produce the fertilizer to be used on a field). There is a Master Item Table in CDS configured specifically for the operation. If there is a blend flag on an order change, it will pull from the Master Item Table. The Worker Table is a translation table required to map the applicator (worker) set up in AgSync to D365. This provides the information of who applied the product to the field and their applicator license number. An applicator license number is required on the sales order. Three entities need to be manually entered in CDS.

The action is not ready to be performed. Not all users can view planned status due to security measures in place (ex: dispatcher unable to see planned work status). - Released: The work orders are released and assigned to complete field work. - The work order comes to F&O regardless of status. - State the performed operation - State the products being utilized - Indicate the impacted crop(s) - Add in any additional notes - Save Order After a work order is saved, AgSync calls the Levridge AgsyncOrderChanged webhook sending over the work order data. The Levridge AgsyncOrderChanged webhook transforms the work order data and sends it to F&O where it creates or updates a corresponding sales order. If F&O accounts receivables are configured to perform a credit check and the credit check fails, F&O will send back a response indicating that the credit check did not pass. Then a rejection request is sent to Agsync to mark the work order as rejected. When F&O receives an updated work order from Agsync, F&O will remove all existing sales order line(s) and create new sale order line(s) to match the Agsync updated work order. This is done to keep the F&O sale order in sync with the possible changes that came through with Agsync updated work order. If a F&O sale's order has an active dispensing work order associated to it, then F&O will not delete or create new sales order line(s). An important item to note: A business process needs to be in place in the situation if AgSync creates a scheduled work order which gets scheduled, and then a dispensing work order is created and gets sent to Kahler. F&O will not pick up new changes if AgSync tries to go back to a release status and make changes and try to reschedule it. AgSync needs to cancel the Kahler order and F&O dispensing order and reschedule their AgSync work order.","title":"Work Order Integration"},{"location":"Agsync/#microsoft-azure-app-service","text":"The Levridge Integration Framework has been written as a web application that hosts HTTP endpoints as REST APIs and background processes that handle integrations.

Once a controller is secured each instance of the Integration Framework in which it is used must be configured in the Active Directory to expose the API. Here is a link to the Microsoft documentation that explains the process of registering an application in Azure Active Directory. Application Managed Identity If the Levridge Integration Framework is deployed in an Azure tenant Microsoft recommends using a managed identity. This makes is much simpler to manage access to Azure resources such as the Azure Service Bus, Azure Key Vault and Azure Configuration Serivice. To setup a system managed identity, use the instructions provided here . You will still need to provide a ClientId . To obtain a ClientId you will need to turn on Security in the Azure Portal. Follow the instructions here to enable security. In one of the steps it has you select the Express option for Azure Active Directory. This creates an Application Registration for you. You can also select an existing Application Registration if you have already created one for the app service. It is the ClientId of the Application Registration that will be used in the AzureAd node of the appsettings.json file. Application Permissions (Roles) Since controllers are generally called by applications that are not using the Azure Active Directory to authenticate users we have configured our controllers to utilize Application Permissions rather than Delegated permissions . Exposing Application Permissions To expose application permissions you must add one or more roles to the registered application manifest. Use this link for specific instructions. Don't forget to provide admin consent. Assigning Application Permissions Once you have exposed application permissions you will need to assign those permissions to the application that will be calling the API. You will assign Application Permissions as opposed to Delegated Permisions. Use this link for specific instructions. Configuring Authorized Roles Once the role(s) are defined as application permissions and the calling application is assigned the necessary permissions you will need to add the role(s) to the InstanceConfig appsettings.json . Configure AzureAd Settings You will need to provide the information necessary to utilize Azure AD to authenticate calls to the controller. See AzureAd Settings for more information. Enabling Security on a Controller At the time of this writing (5/15/2020) we only have security enabled on the default controller. Be careful about enabling security on controllers. Many of the controllers are called by applcations that expect anonymous access. To enable security you will need to add the following attribute to the controller class: [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme + \",\" + JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)] You can simply add the JwtBearer authentication scheme but then you will not be able to access the API from a browser. Allowing Anonymous Access If you have enabled security on a controller but you want certain actions to allow anonymous access you can add the [AllowAnonymous] attribute to the method. If you want all but a few actions to allow anonymous access you can simply add the [Authorize] attribute only to the actions that you want to secure and don't add it to the class. Be sure to specify the Authentication Schemes you want to use or it will simply use the default which is OpenIdConnect.","title":"Configuring Controller Security"},{"location":"ControllerSecurity/#configuring-controller-security","text":"","title":"Configuring Controller Security"},{"location":"ControllerSecurity/#overview","text":"Levridge has provided configurable security for our controllers.

Customer operations and sites are master data concepts in Levridge. They are defined as: Account/Customer: A farm or production organization Customer operation: A farm or livestock operation Customer site: A field or barn Customer site location: A zone in a field or a pen in a barn Contact: Members of a farm or livestock organization. These contacts can be involved in the organization in different ways. For example, a veterinarian or farm hand might be contacts for a farm. An account or customer is who the ag retailer does business with. This party is often referred to as the grower. This party has the financial responsibilities with the Ag retailer. The customer operation is the business entity the account or customer participates in. A customer might be part of multiple customer operations. Products and services are exchanged between the Ag retailer and the customer and the operation the customer is participating in. In Levridge, an Ag retailer could provide feedback in the form of a return on investment (ROI) or balance sheet to the grower based on information delivered to a specific customer operation. Historical information can also be tracked to individuals assigned to or working on the specific operation (ex: agronomist, feed salesperson, tractor driver). This is helpful for corporate farms to be able to break down who is handling what operation. A customer site is a subset of a customer operation. A customer operation might have many customer sites/fields. Data is stored on customer sites and tasks are performed against the sites. For example, the following information can be tracked on a customer site: - Farmable Acres \u2013 used in calculations of seed requirements and fertilizer amounts - County, Township, Plat, etc. - Field Photo - Crop History - Commodity varieties and yields over time - Pest pressures The following example tasks that can be performed against customer sites: - Applications \u2013 track all applications per growing season - Soil Samples \u2013 track all sampling activity As a customer operation can have several customer sites, within the animal feed space, customer sites can have several customer site locations. For example, a barn can have several bins. Split Groups Split groups (commonly referred to as splits) are the link between customers and customer operations. Split groups define how to allocate costs or revenue across the one or more customers involved in the split. For example, if there are 3 different participants involved in a single customer operation, the split group might look like this: Customer A \u2013 40% Customer B \u2013 30% Customer C \u2013 30% Default split groups can be defined for ordering purposes and for commodity interactions with the Ag retailer. These default splits can be set on customer operations or on each customer site which means, if desired, each field can have a different default split group. Default split groups can also be defined at the item category or product level as well. In Levridge, there are two different types of default split groups: 1. Ordering split 2. Commodity split The Commodity default split defines ownership of products when the grower is selling to the Ag retailer. The Ordering default split is used when the grower is buying products from the Ag retailer (that will be utilized in customer sites and operations). Here is How to Create a Split Group in F&O and information on how to Manage Splits, Sales Contracts and Prepayments .","title":"Customer Operations, Customer Sites and Split Groups"},{"location":"CustomerOperations_CustomerSites_SplitGroups/#customer-operations-customer-sites-and-split-groups","text":"","title":"Customer Operations, Customer Sites and Split Groups"},{"location":"CustomerOperations_CustomerSites_SplitGroups/#overview","text":"The following provides an overview of customer operations, customer sites and split groups in Levridge.

The controller looks for this section to get the Service Bus information needed to place messages into a Topic. You can run the Field to CRM integration in the same instance simply by pointing the SourceConfig.ServiceBusConfigName to \"Levridge.Integration.Host.FieldController\" also, or a section that defines a connection to the same topic the controller is sending the message to. For the instance that handles the integration mapping the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes should be setup as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": [section name with service bus topic], \"ODataConfigName\": \"\", \"SystemName\": \"Field\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with CRM data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsCRM\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } In the appsettings.json you will need to add the assembly into the list of controllers. It doesn't matter what name you assign to the assembly entry but the assembly name must be \"Levridge.Integration.Host.FieldController\". In the example below the assembly is named \"FieldController\". (i.e. \"FieldController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.FieldController\") \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"FieldController\":

This document shows how to create a custom field extension to have those custom fields integrated when the entity is being integrated. Overview In order to integrate custom fields you will need to create a Visual Studio solution with upto three projects: Custom Source Proxy Project Contains the proxy for the source datasource with the custom fields in the entities This project is only necessary if there are custom fields in the source. If your customizations only include custom behavior for existing fields then a custom source proxy will not be needed. Custom Destination Proxy Project Contains the proxy for the desitination datasource with the custom fields in the entities This project is only necessary if there are custom fields in the destination. If your customizations only include custom behavior for existing fields then a custom destination proxy will not be needed. Custom Mapping Project Contains the code need to map the integration for the custom fields between the source and destination entities Note: If there are no custom fields involved and you are only defining custom behavior for existing fields you will not need new proxies. You only need a proxy to define the metadata for custom fields. Please see Deploying Custom Field Mapping Assemblies for information on deploying the custom mapping assembly. Tutorial Create the Solution The first step is to create a Visual Studio solution for the custom mapping. In Visual Studio, create a new C# Class Library (.NET Core). You may want to give the solution a different name than the project. In our example, the customer is Comstock so we will name the solution \"ComstockCustomMapping\" and the project Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Mapping.Comstock. We recommend you use this naming convention for your custom mapping project: Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Mapping.[clientname]. Create the Source Proxy Project Create the Destination Proxy Project Add References to the Custom Mapping Project The Levridge packages are published to our DevOps Artifacts so you will need to add a Nuget source for those packages. This is done in Visual Studio from Tools/Options/NuGet Package Manager/Package Sources. The source is https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/stoneridgesoftware/Levridge/_packaging/LevridgePackages-beta/nuget/v3/index.json If you are working the LevDevelopment branch. If you are working in the customer's repository you should use 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/stoneridgesoftware/Levridge/_packaging/LevridgePackages/nuget/v3/index.json' which is the released version of the packages. You will need to add the following Nuget references to your custom mapping project: Levridge.EntityFramework Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Abstractions Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Mapping Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection System.ComponentModel.Composition Note: The Levridge packages are available from our Azure DevOps Artifacts repository. The URL for released packages is https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/stoneridgesoftware/Levridge/_packaging/LevridgePackages/nuget/v3/index.json Add Source and Destination Datasource References to Custom Mapping Project You will need to reference the destination data source project in order to have access to any Field types and other types used during mapping. If your datasource is CRM you would include this reference: * Levridge.ODataDataSources.CRMODataDataSource If your datasource is F&O you would include this reference: * Levridge.DynamicsAxDataSource Update the references to be excluded from deployment These references will be needed for the build process, but we will want to use the libraries provided by the standard deployment and not deploy our own copy of the libraries with the custom mapping assemblies. To accomplish this, we let the msbuild system know to exclude these libraries from the runtime deployment by adding <ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets> to the <PackageReference> node for each package. You should have an <ItemGroup> node that looks somthing like this. <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include=\"Levridge.EntityFramework\" Version=\"2.0.10\"> <ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets> </PackageReference> <PackageReference Include=\"Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Abstractions\" Version=\"1.0.0\"> <ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets> </PackageReference> <PackageReference Include=\"Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Mapping\" Version=\"1.0.0\"> <ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets> </PackageReference> <PackageReference Include=\"Levridge.ODataDataSources.CRMODataDataSource\" Version=\"2.1.15\"> <ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets> </PackageReference> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" Version=\"3.0.2\"> <ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets> </PackageReference> </ItemGroup> Add a reference to the two datasource proxy projects Your custom mapping methods will need to access the source and data entities so you will need to add a reference to the two proxy projects you created in sections Create the Source Proxy Project and Create the Destination Proxy Project If you do not need a custom proxy project you should add a reference package to the correct Levridge nuget package. The F&O and CRM packages are: * Levridge.DynamicsAxDataSource * Levridge.ODataDataSources.DynamicsCRM Create An EntityMapBuilderExtension class We need to have a class that will contain the necessary mapping methods for the custom fields being added to the integration. Create a public class This can not be a static class because Microsoft MEF won't export a static class. Add the [Export] attribute to the class The Export attribute is in the System.ComponentModel.Composition that was added in the section Add References to the Custom Mapping Project Name the class We recommend using something like [client]CustomFieldsEntityMapping. The actual name is not important, orther than to be clear the purpose of the class. In our example we named the class ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapping . Add a public static void method that takes a single IServiceCollection parameter. In our example we added the following method: public static void AddContosoCustomMaps(IServiceCollection services) Add a private static method that takes a single IEntityMapBuilder parameter and returns an IEntityMapBuilder and takes two generic parameters. In our example we added the following method: private static IEntityMapBuilder AddContosoCustomFieldsToMaps<TSource, TTarget>(IEntityMapBuilder builder) Add the following code to the public static method created in step 3 above: var builder = new EntityMapBuilder(services); ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapping.AddContosoCustomFieldsToMaps (builder);` The second line should reference the current class and the method you created in step 4 above. Here is our complete method in the example: public static void AddLandusCustomMaps(IServiceCollection services) { var builder = new EntityMapBuilder(services); ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapping.AddContosoCustomFieldsToMaps (builder); } Note: The namespaces AxEntities and CRMEntities should reference your custom proxies if you created them otherwise it should reference the packaged Levridge provided proxy Add the following code to the private static method created in step 4 above: if (builder == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(builder)); } return EntityMapBuilderHelper.InvokeMappingMethods(builder, typeof(ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapping)); The first block validates the parameter. The last line calls a method on a helper class to invoke all the mapping methods on the class we are now building. Here is our complete method in the example: private static IEntityMapBuilder AddContosoCustomFieldsToMaps (IEntityMapBuilder builder) { if (builder == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(builder)); } return EntityMapBuilderHelper.InvokeMappingMethods(builder, typeof(ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapping)); } Create mapping methods Create a private static method that a single IEntityMapBuilder parameter and returns an IEntityMapBuilder Name the method Map[SourceEntity]_[DestinationEntity]. In our example we added the following method: private static IEntityMapBuilder MapCustomerV3_lev_customer(IEntityMapBuilder builder) This method will add the custom field mapping for CustomerV3 to lev_customer Add an [EntityMapMethod] Attribute to the map method Add mapping code in the map method The mapping code is split into two levels: - AddEntityMap The structure of the AddEntityMap is an extension method on IEntityMapBuilder that takes two generic parameters for the source and target entities and an Action method parameter used to configure the EntityMap by adding field maps for the entities. - AddFieldMap AddFieldMap is a method on EntityMap . There are several that takes two generic parameters for the source field type and target field type and an Action method parameter used to configure the EntityMap by adding field maps for the entities. Here is an example method that adds mapping for CustomerV3 to lev_customer: private static IEntityMapBuilder MapCustomerV3_lev_customer(IEntityMapBuilder builder) { builder.AddEntityMap<AxEntities.CustomerV3, CRMEntities.lev_customer>(em => { em.AddFieldMap<String, String>( new JSONField<String>(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevPrintName)), new CRMODataField<String>(nameof(CRMEntities.lev_customer.lev_name)), (a, b) => { String printName = a.Value; String organizationName = (String)a.FieldEntity[nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.OrganizationName)].Value; return String.IsNullOrEmpty(printName) ? organizationName : printName; }, (b, a) => { throw new IntegrationNotSupportedException(); }); em.AddFieldMap<String, String>( new JSONField<String>(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevInCareOf)), new CRMODataField<String>(nameof(CRMEntities.lev_customer.lev_incareof))); em.AddMapReferencedField(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3), nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevPrintName)); }); return builder; } Example Mapping using System; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Levridge.EntityFramework; using Levridge.ODataDataSources; using Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Abstractions; using AxEntities = ContosoCustomFields.Microsoft.Dynamics.DataEntities; using CRMEntities = ContosoCustomFields.ODataDataSources.DynamicsCRM; using System.ComponentModel.Composition; namespace Levridge.Integration.IntegrationService.Mapping.ContosoCustomFields { [Export] public class ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapBuilderExtensions { public static void AddContosoCustomMaps(IServiceCollection services) { var builder = new EntityMapBuilder(services); ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapBuilderExtensions.AddContosoCustomFieldsToMaps<AxEntities.CustomerV3, CRMEntities.lev_customer>(builder); } private static IEntityMapBuilder AddContosoCustomFieldsToMaps<TSource, TTarget>(IEntityMapBuilder builder) { if (builder == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(builder)); } return EntityMapBuilderHelper.InvokeMappingMethods(builder, typeof(ContosoCustomFieldsEntityMapBuilderExtensions)); } [EntityMapMethod] private static IEntityMapBuilder MapCustomerV3_lev_customer(IEntityMapBuilder builder) { builder.AddEntityMap<AxEntities.CustomerV3, CRMEntities.lev_customer>(em => { em.AddFieldMap<String, String>( new JSONField<String>(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevPrintName)), new CRMODataField<String>(nameof(CRMEntities.lev_customer.lev_name)), (a, b) => { String printName = a.Value; String organizationName = (String)a.FieldEntity[nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.OrganizationName)].Value; return String.IsNullOrEmpty(printName) ? organizationName : printName; }, (b, a) => { throw new IntegrationNotSupportedException(); }); em.AddFieldMap<String, String>( new JSONField<String>(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevInCareOf)), new CRMODataField<String>(nameof(CRMEntities.lev_customer.lev_incareof))); em.AddMapReferencedField(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3), nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevPrintName)); }); return builder; } [EntityMapMethod] private static IEntityMapBuilder MapCustomerV3_account(IEntityMapBuilder builder) { builder.AddEntityMap<AxEntities.CustomerV3, CRMEntities.account>(em => { em.AddFieldMap<String, String>( new JSONField<String>(nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.LevPrintName)), new CRMODataField<String>(nameof(CRMEntities.account.name)), (a, b) => { String printName = a.Value; String organizationName = (String)a.FieldEntity[nameof(AxEntities.CustomerV3.OrganizationName)].Value; return String.IsNullOrEmpty(printName) ? organizationName : printName; }, (b, a) => { throw new IntegrationNotSupportedException(); }); }); return builder; } [EntityMapMethod] private static IEntityMapBuilder MapInventSite_lev_companysite(IEntityMapBuilder builder) { builder.AddEntityMap<AxEntities.InventSite, CRMEntities.lev_companysite>(em => { em.AddFieldMap<String, String>( new JSONField<String>(nameof(AxEntities.InventSite.LevRegionId)), new CRMODataField<String>(nameof(CRMEntities.lev_companysite.stn_region))); }); return builder; } } } Deploying the Custom Mapping Assemblies To deploy the custom assembly you simply copy the output of the mapping assembly to the same directory that contains the Levridge.Integration.Host assemblies.

The integration framework uses Microsoft Azure Service Bus to provide a Publish and Subscribe messaging pattern . Levridge has created an event framework in D365 Finance that will publish entity data to the service bus based on Creates, Deletes and Updates. Information/messages sent to the service bus can be subscribed to by 3rd party applications or by the Levridge integration framework and sent to 3rd party applications like AgSync. The data entities in D365 Finance and can be filtered so only certain records are sent. All integrations that use the framework follow the same pattern: 1. A data source has an integration event 2. The data source responds to the integration event by sending one or more entities to the service bus. 3. The service bus publishes the message(s) to each subscription 4. An instance of the integration framework receives the message(s) from a subscription 5. The integration framework transforms the message if needed 6.

Overview Because this is a bidirectional integration there are two instances of the integration running to handle the entire integration. There is one integration instance for each direction. One aspect of Kahler that is different from other integrations is the D365 F&O to Kahler instance must run on premise because the Kahler system runs behind the firewall. This should be deployed as a service. Another aspect that is different is that each location should only get the messages from the topic that apply to that location. This is done with a filter on the service bus topic subscription. In order for the filter to work the Levridge Entity Event must be configured to expose the branch property on the message. Required Resources Security permissions to access sales orders, transfer orders, and transportation maangement system in D365 F&O Security permissions and access to Kahler's system Setup To integrate to and from Kahler and D365 F&O you will need to: Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Orders (D365 F&O to Kahler) Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Records (Kahler to D365 F&O) Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Order topic for each Branch that has a Kahler mixer Create a filter on the subscription for each Branch Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Record topic for integration back to F&O Configure Event Endpoint in F&O Configure Levridge Entity Events You will need to be sure to provide properties on the event to allow filtering by Branch Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 F&O Create an Azure Active Directory Application in D365 F&O Set up Azure Key Vault / Overview Deploy the Levridge Integration Framework as a service at each Branch that has a Kahler mixer Configuration for Kahler on Premise This configuration will need to be on premise with the Kahler mixer. The on-premise instance will handle the Dispensing Work Order from D365 F&O to Kahler and the Webhook that receives Dispensing Work Records from Kahler. The configuration of D365 F&O is required to release to Kahler. Within the release product itself, default warehouses must be defined to ensure that under Manage Inventory default warehouses are set up with a dispensing method to be able to ship to a Kahler. The dispensing method is a 1:1 ration (1 warehouse 1 dispensing method). This configuration produces a URL that is an identifier for each Kahler. Each Kahler instance has its own URL and that URL must be attached to the product to ensure it is sent to the correct web hub. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the InstanceConfig SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"InstanceConfig\": { \"AzureTableConfiguration\": \"[section name to Azure Table Configuration\", \"LogRequestsAndResponses\": [true or false] \"EnableAppInsightsAdaptiveSampling\": [true or false] }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"[section name with Dispensing Work Order service bus topic]\", \"ODataConfigName\": \"[section name with F&O data configuration]\", \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"[section name with Kahler data configuration]\", \"CDSConfigName\": \"[section name with CDS data configuration]\", \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } Here is a sample template for the entire appsettings.json file used for the on-premise deployment of the integration from FinOps to Kahler: { \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"KahlerConroller\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\" }, \"Logging\": { \"Debug\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"Console\": { \"IncludeScopes\": true, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\", \"ApplicationInsights\": { \"InstrumentationKey\": \"08f05bc5-e901-4c19-8358-286bdcedf35e\" }, \"InstanceConfig\": { \"AzureTableConfiguration\": \"[section name to Azure Table Configuration\", \"LogRequestsAndResponses\": [true or false] \"EnableAppInsightsAdaptiveSampling\": [true or false] }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Order\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Order service bus topic] \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"Kahler End Point\", //[section name with Kahler data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": \"[section name with CDS data configuration]\", \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]\", \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]\", \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": \"[Application ID used to register the application in AD]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": \"[Client Secret generated for the Application ID in AD]\", \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Kahler End Point\": { \"UriString\": \"[URL to Local Kahler]\" }, \"Dispensing Work Order\": { \"ConnectionString\": \"[connection string to Dispensing Work Order Topic]\", \"TopicName\": \"[Dispensing Work Order Topic Name]\", \"SubscriptionName\": \"[Subscription Name for the Branch]\", \"RequiresSession\": true }, \"CDS\": { \"UriString\": \"[URL to CDS or Localhost]\", \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": \"[URL to CDS]\", \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": \"[Application ID used to register the application in AD]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": \"[Client Secret generated for the Application ID in AD]\", \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to CDS]/api/data/v9.0/\", \"AssemblyName\": \"Levridge.ODataDataSources.CDS\", \"ClientClassesNameSpace\": \"Levridge.ODataDataSources.CDS\", \"MetadataResource\": \"CDSMetadata.xml\" }, \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\": { \"ConnectionString\": \"[connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic]\", \"TopicName\": \"[Dispensing Work Record Topic Name]\", \"RequiresSession\": true } } Controllers This section contains a list of controllers that will be loaded by the current instance. In addition to the default controller that we always want to load, we want the system to load the Kahler controller. The names (on the left) are not significant and are used only for debugging. The values (on the right) are significant. It must be the name of the assembly that should be loaded for the controller. InstanceConfig InstanceConfig is an object in the appsettings.json file used by the Levridge Integration Framework to define the configuration for the Current Instance of the integration framework. SourceConfig The source config will represent the data being send from D365 F&O. Currently, the Dispensing Work Order is the only entity sent from F&O. In the future the topic may also include master data that is sent to Kahler. The ODataConfigName is not currently being used but is a required value. So point it to the section that contains the connection information to D365 F&O. TargetConfig The target config will represent the data endpoint for the local Kahler mixer. The \"ODataConfigName\" should point to a section that contains the Kahler REST endpoint. Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController This section is used by the Kahler controller to be able to send messages to the proper topic to be handled by the integration framework and written to D365 F&O. Configuration for Kahler in Azure This instance can be a single instance running in the cloud. This instance will handle the Dispensing Work Record from Kahler to D365 F&O. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the InstanceConfig SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"InstanceConfig\": { \"AzureTableConfiguration\": \"[section name to Azure Table Configuration\", \"LogRequestsAndResponses\": [true or false] \"EnableAppInsightsAdaptiveSampling\": [true or false] }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"[section name with Dispensing Work Record service bus topic]\" \"ODataConfigName\": \"\", \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"[section name with F&O data configuration]\", \"CDSConfigName\": \"[section name with CDS configuration]\", \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } Here is a template of the full appsettings.json file used for the Kahler integration from the Webhook to FinOps: { \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\" }, \"Logging\": { \"ApplicationInsights\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Trace\" } }, \"Debug\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"Console\": { \"IncludeScopes\": true, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\" } }, \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\", \"InstanceConfig\": { \"AzureTableConfiguration\": \"[section name to Azure Table Configuration\", \"LogRequestsAndResponses\": [true or false] \"EnableAppInsightsAdaptiveSampling\": [true or false] }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Record\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Record service bus topic] \"ODataConfigName\": \"\", \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"CDSConfigName\": \"CDS\", \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]\", \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]\", \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": \"[Application ID used to register the application in AD]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": \"[Client Secret generated for the Application ID in AD]\", \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Dispensing Work Record\": { \"ConnectionString\": \"[connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic]\", \"TopicName\": \"[Dispensing Work Record Topic Name]\", \"SubscriptionName\": \"[Subscription Name for Integration to D365 F&O]\", \"RequiresSession\": true } } Dispensing Method Configuration Release Products Grid Highlight line Manage Inventory Warehouse Tab Warehouse Items Dispensing Method field Select the warehouse that should be tied to the dispensing method Select the appropriate configure dispensing method Add Kahler specific URL If the URL is not setup properly for each product, the product could be sent to an incorrect Kahler location. This step is critical to ensure the setup and configurations are accurate. Sales Order Statuses Planned (generated sales order) Booked Released (order is sent to dispatcher work board) Scheduled (generates dispensing work record and assigns application site) Completed Once the order is in a scheduled status, it will generate a dispnsing work record which kicks off the integration to send the product to Kahler. Once Kahler completes the dispatching of product and the onsite work is completed, the work order status is updated to either completed, pending, or review. Data is populated in the work order completion tab in F&O. Work Order Completion Rolling stock ID (task completion equipment) Weather information Humidity Temperature Wind speed Wind direction Pests Acreage completed Start and end times Acmount of actual product applied Once the work is completed by the dispatcher, the work order status updated to the final completion stage (complete/verify). Picking List Within each order, there is a possibility of multiple picking lists. Picking lists annotate the amount of batches/truck loads left Kahler and the mix in each truck. Picking lists allow one to know how many loads are being used. There are two bill options: 1. Bill what Kahler said was used 2. Bill for what the machine stated was used Transportation Management System (TMS) has the ability to generate a freight bill after Kahler sends the picking lists to ensure the third party contractor delivering the product is paid. The steps below outline the process: 1. Data from Kahler creates a picking list 2. Load creation in TMS 3. Generate freight bill invoiceable to the third party contractor Packing Order A packing slip is generated for the work order in an invoiceable status. Packing orders can take place either in the complete, pending, review status or in the complete, verify status. Generate Order Manually The below outlines the steps required to generate a manual order. 1. Create a sales order. The information collected in the sales order includes: - Who the grower is - The inventory location the product is being picked up at 2. Generate product to be shipped to Kahler - Individual products - Custom configuration BOM - Select configuration BOM - Product and supply - Configure line - Configure selected item (product type and amount) - Click OK (BOM is generated) - Select blending site - Save - Explode BOM back out 3. Warehouse items tab - Release for dispensing - Generates dispensing ID - Order is sent to Kahler 4. Manually pack, slip, and post Manual Transfer Order Transfer orders allow product to be moved from one site to another. The below outlines the process: 1. Inventory management 2. Transfer order 3. Populate \"From\" and \"To\" warehouses 4. Add line 5. Select product and amont of product to be transferred 6. Save Ship 7. Release for dispensing 8. Transfer order is sent to Kahler to act on physical shipping of the product.","title":"Kahler"},{"location":"Kahler/#kahler-integration","text":"The Kahler integration is a bidirectional integration that consists of a Topic for Dispensing Work Orders that go from D365 F&O to Kahler and Dispensing Work Records that go from Kahler to D365 F&O with the goal of margin control and recognizing revenue across site locations.","title":"Kahler Integration"},{"location":"Kahler/#overview","text":"Because this is a bidirectional integration there are two instances of the integration running to handle the entire integration.

Our primary target for logging is Azure Application Insights however we can also log to the Windows Event Log. This can be usefull if the integration framework is running as a windows service and does not have highspeed internet access to send log data to Application Insights. Log Settings In the appsettings.json file there is a \"Logging\" section that defines the log settings for the various logging providers. A typical logging section may look like this. \"Logging\": { \"ApplicationInsights\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Trace\" } }, \"Debug\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Trace\" } }, \"Console\": { \"IncludeScopes\": true, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Trace\" } }, \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Warning\" } }, Unless you are using Debug or Console logging the only setting you need to be concerned with is the ApplicationInsights object. In a typical production environment you will want this set to \"Information\" or \"Warning\" rather than trace. However, to troubleshoot issues you may need to set this to \"Trace\". Valid Log Levels Here are the valid log level settings: Setting Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment. Debug Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term value. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value. Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. None Not used for writing log messages. Specifies that a logging category should not write any messages. Levridge Guidance for using Log Levels In order to provide a consistent user experience when using the configuration to adjust the log levels we need to have a consistent practice accross all of our code for what information is logged at what level. Generally speaking we would like to have logging set to Information in production unless there is a need to troubleshoot a specific issue. At this level we should be able to see all errors and warnings along with usefull information for basic troubleshooting. Here is what Levridge is logging at the different levels: Trace Log variable states, parameters & request and response payloads as Trace items. Use trace to log verbose information and large payloads. These items may can cause performance issues during normal operation. Debug Log any information that inidates the basic flow of the code. Examples include something like \"Entering POST method\" or \"Enabling authentication.\" This is general information that helps someone follow the flow of the code and can be useful in determining what is happening when an error occures. Information Log specific state information. For example \"Recieved Order 1234\" or \"Enabling AzureAd authentication scheme.\" These messages provide specific instance and state information. For example, in the trace section we showed an example \"Enabling authenticaction\". The represents the current code that is executing but not any instance or state information. On the other hand, logging \"Enabling AzureAd authentication scheme\" tells us which type of authenticaion is being enabled. Warning Log abnormal situations that do not warrent stopping the application and do not leave the application in an unkown state. Error Log error conditions from which we can recover. Critical Log all exceptions as critical. Include as much state information as possible to help with troubleshooting the root cause of the exception.

Patronage dividends are given based on a proportion of profit that the business makes. Once this amount is determined, management calculates the dividend according to how much each member has used the co-op's services. It is typically an annual process of generating dividends and equity balances. Managing this process has been streamlined and simplified within the Levridge solution. In a few simple steps, you can accurately set up splits, distributions, equity, reports, and cut checks. Implementation Activities The Implementation Activities for Patronage provides an overview of the implementation activities necessary for getting started with processing Patronage. Base Type Functionality The Patronage solutions is operated on Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (CE) functionality, with an integration from F&O. There is certain functionality that is reliant on the integration between F&O and CE Patronage to get the data into the system, one of those being \u201cProducts\u201d under the Setup navigation area. All the products listed are integrated over from F&O. D365 CE Setup Functionality Products The Product form includes multiple views. This is accomplished by clicking on a certain product line. The two main factors related to Patronage are: 1. Eligible for Patronage: This field is set to either yes or no. 2. Patronage unit: The goal is to know how Patronage is paid out on a product. Products can be sold in different types of unit, for example: ounce, pound, ton, vs. bushel, bag, individually. The default sales unit can be different than the Patronage itself. For example, a product sold in pounds but paid in tons. The Item Category, Relationship to the Product, and Products under Site Navigator are reliant on the integration between F&O and CE Patronage. They are areas integrated from F&O. An important item to note is outlining what item category relates to which Patronage category. The Patronage category is the determining factor of what items will be calculated and what items will be pulled in at different rates based. Stock Classes This section allows a cooperative to set up stock classes. Some cooperatives will have many stock classes, some will have none. Periods Periods include calendar and fiscal periods. These are not integrated from F&O and set up on CE Patronage. - Fiscal period: 1099PATR reporting is run on calendar year, requiring the fiscal period to include a year calendar. - Split due date: A Patronage Split is how a grower would like their patronage eligible transactions to be split to another grower. The Split due date is the date the annual member letters must be returned by. This used when cooperatives send their annual letters to their members and the date they request the letter to be returned. - Minimum Spend: This is the minimum spend amount within a period to receive patronage. There is currently no functionality around this field and more for informational purposes. - Minimum Voting Activity: There is currently no functionality around this field and more for informational purposes. Sources Sources is where the transactional data comes from including previous years. You could have multiple sources if you have had mergers or acquisitions with other cooperatives. They include rules and regulations from mergers and acquisitions with other cooperatives. With those cooperatives comes different rules and regulations, and this is where cooperatives can identify where those transactions come from, different payout rates, and what rules should apply. If a cooperative has not undergone a merger or acquisition, there will more than likely be only one source information. - Primary retirement age: This field is used to set up the retirement age that members will get paid out. This annotates what age the member is eligible to receive Patronage. - Secondary retirement age: This field is used as a secondary option to pay out Patronage. This is the age where Patronage pay outs are mandatory. There is currently no functionality around this field and more for informational purposes. - Default stock class: There is currently no functionality around this field and more for informational purposes. - Minimum payout threshold: Can enter the minimum amount the company will pay patronage on. This is informational and can be used building the payment summary export if included in the query that is built. - Minimum Dividend percentage: Can enter the minimum percentage to receive dividends. This is informational and can be included when building queries. - ERP System: This field is to track where the ERP system information comes from. There is currently no functionality around this field and more for informational purposes. - 1099PATR Filing Entity: This field annotates if a member is filing a 1099PATR. If set to yes, the source is available to create 1099-PATR records for and you can populate the information on the Filing Details tab. - The Filings Details tab outlines the information required on a 1099PATR electronic filing report. - Address, Phone number, Tax ID number, Name, Contact Imported Transaction An Imported Transaction includes the Transaction Details, outlining the Invoice Number, Branch, Source, and the ability to mark whether it is an eligible transaction. The \u201cCreate Patronage Detail\u201d process needs to be run to create eligible transactions utilizing the patronage splits defined on the account record. There is the traceability functionality under \u201cEligible Transactions\u201d where you can view where the transactions came from and how they are being processed and utilized throughout the system. Customer Information Account Form Account Information: The fields are integrated over from F&O. Patronage Contact: is who would be receiving the retirement benefits. Estate Contact: in the case if a member dies and want to identify who we should be working out on behalf of their estate. No functional relevance as what is calculated. Purely who we should talk to if there are questions on payouts. Membership: These fields are integrated over from F&O and include: Membership Type, Tax ID Number, Tax ID Type. Patronage Split Lines: Patronage Split Lines are stored in the Patronage CE and used to calculate the eligible transactions which patronage can be calculated from. Patronage Summary: Displays the equity and payment summary for the account. Summarized by period, payout type, distribution type, and source Stock Summary: Displays the total stock subscriptions by stock class for the account. Reports There are several reporting statements available per account, to include: allocation and payment by account. Stocks Stock Subscriptions outline how many shares one has in a certain stock along with payment date, amount, and certificate number. Stock transfers and adjustments can be completed within the system. There are two stock types: 1. Account type: A transfer of stock to another account. There is the option for an approval process under this type. 2. Stock class type: Changing stocks into another type of stock. Adjustments: if there was a data entry error or, one can make adjustments. This field is highly auditable with several restrictions D365 Finance and Operations Patronage Customers The Customer Account information includes a Membership tab for informational data. It does not drive functionality. It includes the following fields: - Membership Type, Patron, Membership Date, Member ID, and Legal Classification - Legal classification is utilized with 1099PATR reporting Released Product Details includes the Patronage unit where fields on the product need to be set up. The unit conversions come from the Patronage unit field and needs to be set up through F&O to be able to calculate the right unit when you switch over to D365 CE. Payment Details By clicking on \u201cProcess patronage\u201d, one can pull invoices within a specific date range, reading the invoice lines not creating. Converting the invoiced units to patronage units if the patronage unit is different on the released items. It also pulls in charge codes or discounts. Charge codes can be set up to either increase in price or decrease in price depending on how your rules are set up. When a sales order is generated, the F&O will break up the sales order into split allocations, creating an invoice to the customers financially responsible for what was delivered. From the information generated, one can export the data into an Excel file or CSV file to import into CE. This is done by \"Imported Transactions\" under the standard import functionality. You can then filter the list and \"Create Patronage Detail\". This takes the information you have from your patronage splits and whether this item is chargeable and nonchargeable and creates your eligible transactions. The data needs to be in the right format to be imported into CE and can be imported from any system, not just F&O. Eligible Transactions Patronage processing is generated once all eligible transactions have been created. One does not need to bring in imported transactions if they do not use splits or are already split out, they can import right into Eligible Transactions. These are the records that will be used when calculating the equity credit and payments through Patronage Category allocations. Patronage Categories Patronage categories are set up based on what is being paid out and based on sources. If a cooperative has had mergers or acquisitions, or importing categories from previous years, there will likely be a variety of categories Patronage has been processed under. The categories can be calculated by revenue or by units. Direct products are not associated directly to a patronage category instead they choose the item categories of those products. Based on that relationship between item category and product that is what is determined which eligible transactions to pull in when it runs that calculation. An item category can only belong to one patronage category. All the eligible transactions are siphoned into the Patronage Category Allocation. Eligible transactions need to be listed as a sale or purchase. The Percent of Revenue is the total percent of revenue and dictates the Cash Percentage, creating a payment detail. The remaining of that would create an Equity Credit paid out later. These calculations can apply to certain branches. If a Patronage Category is calculated by Units, instead of reference how much is purchased, you are referencing quantity. It is classified as a rate if based on units. The Cash percentage would create a payment detail record with the rest going to an equity credit. Which the traceability you can view were created from that process. If the Patronage Category is calculated by units, Section199A Allocations can be set up which appear on the 1099PATR Deductions will be generated based on units purchased and the payout rate under a Specific Section1 allocation. This feeds into the 1099PATR processing. Once the allocation is run, one can no longer generate a new transaction. It becomes inactive. The other section that is created from this allocation is an equity credit. Equity Equity Credits If an equity is not paid out in the current calendar year, it moves into an equity credit value that would later determine what would be paid out This is created from the Patronage Calculation. These credits are run every year based on the items purchased or sold within that year to see how much would be paid out in the current year along with future years. An equity credit can be adjusted. Equity Revolvements Equity Revolvements are used to determine what to pay out on existing equity credits from prior years. Here is where you annotate what percentage to pay out for a certain source, class, distribution type, or period. Based on that criteria, payment detail records are created. You can set up a Payment Schedule for the credits to be paid out in multiple years. Retirement Equity This can be a manual or run process. The equity summary shows how much equity is available to be paid out and is a tracking mechanism to view whether one qualifies for a payout and if they request one. If a payout is requested, one can create payment details and send over to the system being utilized to for payouts. This process is traceable. Annual Allocations The 1099 information is located under the Annual Allocations navigation. It includes: - Deductions - Non-Patronage Distribution - 1099 Credits - 1099 PATR ##### 1099 PATR The 1099 PATR is a form a cooperative files for each person whom: - The cooperative has paid at least $10 in patronage dividends and other distributions described in IRS tax section 6044(b). - The cooperative withheld any federal income tax under the backup withholding rules regardless of the amount of the payment. When a cooperative collects new information for a 1099 year, they would create a new 1099 PATR form. Under 1099 PATR, click \u201cBuild 1099 PATR\u201d - A dialog box will open asking to select the following: - 1099 Year (a calendar year) - Source (where you want the information to be coming from) - This is the information collected previously under Source. - Click Generate. This generates the records requested and pulls in the details required for the form. - Additional items that make up a 1099 PATR form include: - General Account Information - 1099 Credit - This includes a variety of credit types available. - Deductions - Records created from Patronage categories - Non-Patronage Distributions - Includes all the source data that made up the record. This is necessary for auditing purposes - Payments - Equity Credits - Related The 1099 PATR form is used for electronic filing. The cooperative can print either 1099 PATR-B or 1099 PATR-C versions of the 1099 PATR to provide to their members for tax purposes. The 1099 PATR form is also available online and can be accessed through a portal for members to download. Patronage Power BI Dashboards There are several dashboards available for Patronage through Power BI. These are powerful reporting tools to analyze and view key Patronage data and summaries. They are located: Customer Info navigation tab > Customers > Customer Info > Add Dashboards > Patronage Dashboard The following dashboards are already pre-loaded: - 1099A Deductions - Allocation Summary - Eligible Transactions - Equity Credit - Equity Revolvements - Patronage Dashboard Payment Details and Summary The Patronage Category Process creates an individual payment detail record for each eligible transaction. There is a summarize payment option that if you use the Advanced Find functionality received with CE, you can put in any sort of query you want to show payment details and from there can \"Generate Payment Summary\". This would summarize all the records. Once you have that summary detail, you can export it to an Excel file. This is the data you would bring into your financial system. Once the data is exported, you can go into F&O under Accounts Payable and import the data. This will create a vendor invoice for each record. Once you have the vendor invoices, you can create a journal specific to Patronage. There are designations for specific invoice journals for Patronage. The Patronage journal is different from a standard invoice journal due to bringing in and identifying the customer account. A core function in F&O is when those transactions are processed and imported from CE, F&O can pay out on a different account (a financial split vs payment split). Once in F&O, the customer can decide where they would like the distribution to be sent to and the allocated percentage. There are variety of payment journals one can choose from. When journals are set up to pay out, ensure equity payment is specified along with the check and device format. There are up to five options to choose from. There is the ability for multiple check formats and the ability to include additional information on check stubs. This is located under Payment Proposal.","title":"Equity Management"},{"location":"Patronage/#patronage","text":"","title":"Patronage"},{"location":"Patronage/#overview","text":"Patronage is a dividend or distribution that a co-operative pays to its members or investors.

If a cooperative has had mergers or acquisitions, or importing categories from previous years, there will likely be a variety of categories Patronage has been processed under. The categories can be calculated by revenue or by units. Direct products are not associated directly to a patronage category instead they choose the item categories of those products. Based on that relationship between item category and product that is what is determined which eligible transactions to pull in when it runs that calculation. An item category can only belong to one patronage category. All the eligible transactions are siphoned into the Patronage Category Allocation. Eligible transactions need to be listed as a sale or purchase. The Percent of Revenue is the total percent of revenue and dictates the Cash Percentage, creating a payment detail. The remaining of that would create an Equity Credit paid out later. These calculations can apply to certain branches. If a Patronage Category is calculated by Units, instead of reference how much is purchased, you are referencing quantity. It is classified as a rate if based on units. The Cash percentage would create a payment detail record with the rest going to an equity credit. Which the traceability you can view were created from that process. If the Patronage Category is calculated by units, Section199A Allocations can be set up which appear on the 1099PATR Deductions will be generated based on units purchased and the payout rate under a Specific Section1 allocation. This feeds into the 1099PATR processing. Once the allocation is run, one can no longer generate a new transaction. It becomes inactive.

A core function in F&O is when those transactions are processed and imported from CE, F&O can pay out on a different account (a financial split vs payment split). Once in F&O, the customer can decide where they would like the distribution to be sent to and the allocated percentage. There are variety of payment journals one can choose from.

This document provides and overview of the integration framework and links to the document that exists for the framework. Overview The Levridge Integration Framework is an entity syncronization framework. It provides a means to synchronize data at an entity level between multiple data sources. All integrations that use the framework follow the same pattern: 1. A data source has an integration event 2. The data source responds to the integration event by sending one or more entities to the service bus. 3. The service bus publishes the message(s) to each subscription 4. An instance of the integration framework receives the message(s) from a subscription 5. The integration framework transforms the message it if needed 6. The integration framework sends the message to the target data source Integrations Currently we support the following integrations: - D365 F&O to D365 CRM - D365 CRM to D365 F&O - Kahler - Agsync - oneWeigh - Field Reveal - Surety - Levridge Scale House D365 F&O to D365 CRM Setup To integrate from D365 F&O to D365 CRM you will need to: - configure Levridge Entity Events - Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 CRM - Create an application user in D365 CRM and assign the proper role(s) - Create an Azure Service bus topic - Create a subscription on the topic above Configuration In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": [section name with service bus topic], \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with F&O data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with CRM data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsCRM\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } D365 CRM to D365 F&O Setup To integrate from D365 CRM to D365 F&O you will need to: - Configure Azure Service Bus Endpoint in CRM - Configure Azure Service Bus plugin on the appropriate entities - Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 F&O - Create an Azure Active Directory Application in D365 F&O - Create an Azure Service bus topic - Create a subscription on the topic above Configuration In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": [section name with service bus topic], \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with CRM data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsCRM\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": [section name with F&O data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" } Kahler The Kahler integration is a bidirectional integration that consists of a Topic for Dispensing Work Orders that go from D365 F&O to Kahler and Dispensing Work Records that go from Kahler to D365 F&O. This means there are two instances of the integration running to handle the entire integration. One aspect of Kahler that is different from other integrations is the D365 F&O to Kahler instance must run on premise because the Kahler system runs behind the firewall. This should be deployed as a service. Another aspect that is different is that each location should only get the messages from the topic that apply to that location. This is done with a filter on the service bus topic subscription. In order for the filter to work the Levridge Entity Event must be configured to expose the branch property on the message. Setup To integrate to and from Kahler and D365 F&O you will need to: - Configure Levridge Entity Events - You will need to be sure to provide properties on the event to allow filtering by Branch - Create an application ID for the integration framework to authenticate to D365 F&O - Create an Azure Active Directory Application in D365 F&O - Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Orders (D365 F&O to Kahler) - Create an Azure Service bus topic for Dispensing Work Records (Kahler to D365 F&O) - Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Order topic for each Branch that has a Kahler mixer - Create a filter on the subscription for each Branch - Create a subscription on the Dispensing Work Record topic for integration back to F&O - Deploy the Levridge Integration Framework as a service at each Branch that has a Kahler mixer Configuration for Kahler on Premise This configuration will need to be on premise with the Kahler mixer. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"Controllers\": { \"HostController\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.DefaultController\", \"KahlerConroller\": \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\" }, \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Order\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Order service bus topic] \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"Kahler End Point\", //[section name with Kahler data configuration], \"CDSConfigName\": [section name with CDS data configuration], \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": [Application ID used to register the application in AD], \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": [Client Secret genrated for the Application ID in AD], \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Kahler End Point\": { \"UriString\": [URL to Local Kahler] }, \"Dispensing Work Order\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Order Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Order Topic Name], \"SubscriptionName\": [Subscription Name for the Branch], \"RequiresSession\": true }, \"Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Record Topic Name], \"RequiresSession\": true } Controllers This section contains a list of controllers that will be loaded by the current instance. In addition to the default controller that we alwasy want to load, we want the system to load the Kahler controller. The names (on the left) are not significant and are used only for debugging. The values (on the right) are significant. It must be the name of the assembly that should be loaded for the controller. SourceConfig The source config will represent the data being send from D365 F&O. Currently, the Dispensing Work Order is the only entity sent from F&O. In the future the topic may also include master data that is sent to Kahler. The ODataConfigName is not currently being used but is a required value. So point it to the section that contains the connection information to D365 F&O. TargetConfig The target config will represent the data endpoint for the local Kahler mixer. The \"ODataConfigName\" should point to a section that contains the Kahler REST endpoint. Levridge.Integration.Host.KahlerController This section is used by the Kahler controller to be able to send messages to the proper topic to be handled by the integration framework and written to D365 F&O Configuration for Kahler in Azure This instance can be a single instance runing in the cloud. In the appsettings.json you will need to define the SourceConfig and TargetConfig nodes as follows: \"SourceConfig\": { \"ServiceBusConfigName\": \"Dispensing Work Record\", //[section name with Dispensing Work Record service bus topic] \"SystemName\": \"Kahler\", \"Direction\": \"Source\" }, \"TargetConfig\": { \"ODataConfigName\": \"DynamicsAX\", //[section name with F&O data configuration] \"SystemName\": \"DynamicsAX\", \"Direction\": \"Target\" }, \"DynamicsAX\": { \"UriString\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryResource\": [URL to D365 F&O], \"ActiveDirectoryTenant\": \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Customer_Tenant_ID]\", \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppId\": [Application ID used to register the application in AD], \"ActiveDirectoryClientAppSecret\": [Client Secret genrated for the Application ID in AD], \"ODataEntityPath\": \"[URL to D365 F&O]/data/\" }, \"Dispensing Work Record\": { \"ConnectionString\": [connection string to Dispensing Work Record Topic], \"TopicName\": [Dispensing Work Record Topic Name], \"SubscriptionName\": [Subscription Name for Integration to D365 F&O], \"RequiresSession\": true } Agsync oneWeigh Field Reveal Surety Levridge Scale House","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"ReadMe%20%282%29/#introduction","text":"The Levridge integration framework provides integration between Dynamics365 Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement and 3rd party applications.

The LevridgeScaleApp structure is a browser-based Scale application with the functionality of being able to operate as a server or as a desktop. 1. IIS (Internet Information Services) which is a Microsoft web server. 2. A Windows desktop, which is a background Windows service. The functionality is chosen based on the specific requirements of the clients. If the client\u2019s functionality only includes a Windows desktop station, Levridge Scale App can be run as a service capability as not every scale will have a server.

This is very important for implementation purposes. Required server information include the Printer Server and API Server. Clients are always classified as \u201cserver\u201d regardless if operating as a service or server. The intent is the client operates to serve content to the client. The two servers are: 1. LevScaleAPI - This server handles all the back-end calls. This is where the integration framework communications with the scale. O-Data calls which are in turn the integration framework. O-Data is very necessary due to the ability to operate with other ERP systems. 2. LevScalePrint - This server renders all the reports for printing. It communicates with the client printer service. This is within the .net framework. Desktop Environment Service Functionality The four services within a Windows desktop environment include: LevPrintService Can install the LevPrintService to any computer within a client\u2019s Intranet. It has the capability of rendering reports at any location if the LevPrintClient is registered at the specific location. This also includes the Zebra printing capability. LevHardwareService This is the service that handles communication with hardware such as the scale head. LevridgeAXToScale Along with LevridgeScaleToAX is the integration framework. The ratio would be one LevridgeAXToScale and one for the current desktop or LevScale instance. This enables F&O to broadcast all internal information that is necessary. LevridgeAXToScale would be looking at the specific service bus channel.

It contains classes in the following categories: * Mapping Unit Test Helper Classes * Service Bus Helper and Mock classes * Integration Test Helper Classes Mapping Unit Test Helper Classes EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper The EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper class contains static methods you can use to obtain an EntityMapProvider<> for a particular scenario and methods to execute A2B and B2A synchronization using the EntityMapProvider<> obtained. To create a unit test that can test a mapping scenario, reference this library in your test project. Then create a unit test using the following steps: Call GetEntityMapProvider (Type entityMapBuilderType, string methodName) passing the source target template parameter types as defined on the mapping method along with the class that contains the mapping method and the name of the mapping method that you want to test. For example, to test the mapping for AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor and ScaleHouseEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor make the following call: var mapProvider = EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper.GetEntityMapProvider<AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor, ScaleHouseEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor>(typeof(AxToScaleEntityMapBuilderExtensions), \"MapAXScaleTicketGradeFactor_ScaleHouseScaleTicketGradeFactor\"); Instantiate and populate the entities you want to use for mapping. I prefer to use the [MemberData] attribute to provide multiple instances for testing. See this article for example on providing data for unit tests. Use the EntityMapProvider<> to perform the mapping by calling one of the transform methods on The EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper class. For example, to test the B2A mapping for the previous example use the following code: AXentity = EntityMapBuilderExtensionsTestHelper.TransformB2A(mapProvider, ScaleEntity, AXentity); Assert - check the mapped values In order to test the expected values you should have an instance of the target object with the expected values and then get the transformed object from the target entity and compare the two. You can pass in an object with the expected values using the MemberData method. Example: // Get target object var targetObject = AXentity.GetEntityAsDotNetType<AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor>(); // Assert Assert.NotNull(targetObject); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.GradeFactorId, targetObject.GradeFactorId); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.GradeFactorValue, targetObject.GradeFactorValue); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.TicketNumber, targetObject.TicketNumber); Assert.Equal(expectedResult.LineNumber, targetObject.LineNumber); Using MemberData to Provide Unit Test Data If you want to use the MemberData method for building data to use in your unit tests (you can refer to this article for an over view) here are some ideas. 1. Create Methods to Instantiate and Populate the Source and Expected Target Objects I would recommend creating a private static method on your test class that recieves parameters that can be used to initialize the class with the desired values. If you need several parameters you can put them in an object array or Key Value pair or even a dictionary. Example: private static AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(int line, string id, string value, string ticketNumber) { return new AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor() { LineNumber = line, GradeFactorId = id, GradeFactorValue = decimal.Parse(value), TicketNumber = ticketNumber }; } 2. Create Methods to Instantiate and Populate the Source and Target Entities Once you have a populated source object you can use it to instantiate and initialize a source Entity. Example: private static Entity GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor scaleTicketGradeFactor = null) { var axScaleTicketGradeFactor = scaleTicketGradeFactor ?? new AxEntities.ScaleTicketGradeFactor(); Entity entity = DynamicsAxEntities.Instance.GetScaleTicketGradeFactorEntity(); entity.CreateAndPopulateEntityFields(typeof(JSONField<>), axScaleTicketGradeFactor); return entity; } As you can see, if an object is provided, it is used to initialize the Entity. Otherwise a default object is used. 3. Implement the MemberData Method As described in this article for an over view) the MemberData method must return IEnumerable<object[]> . You can craete a method that uses the methods described in the previous steps to create source & target entities along with a target expected object. Then you can define that method using the [MemberData] attribute. Here is an example MemberData method: public static IEnumerable<object[]> GetSynchronizeA2BGradeFactorData() { return new List<object[]> { new object[] { GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(1, \"A\", \"8\", \"0000169\")), GetScaleHouseGradeFactorEntity(), GetScaleHouseTicketGradeFactorObject(1, \"A\", \"8\", \"0000169\") }, new object[] { GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(2, \"AB\", \"0.3\", \"0000169\")), GetScaleHouseGradeFactorEntity(), GetScaleHouseTicketGradeFactorObject(2, \"AB\", \"0.3\", \"0000169\") }, new object[] { GetAxTicketGradeFactorEntity(GetAxTicketGradeFactorObject(3, \"AS\", \"31.3\", \"0000169\")), GetScaleHouseGradeFactorEntity(), GetScaleHouseTicketGradeFactorObject(3, \"AS\", \"31.3\", \"0000169\") } }; } Example Unit Test Here is an example unit test that tests Ticket Grade Factor entities from the ScaleHouse application to F&O.

This window is used to choose the correct printers for each of your scale heads at a location, and to choose a corresponding menu color to know which scale head you are working with in your window. The printer settings you choose in this window will then default in when you choose that scale on the Application start page. Note: This setup is required. The printer selection can be changed to any printer on the Start page, but default printer setup is required to be able to print scale tickets. To Set up the Printer Settings for a Scale: Choose the scale you want to set up from the drop down on the top of the page. Choose your printers for both your Tickets and BOL. Using the printer Type can change between a full page printout vs. a receipt printout. Choose the number of copies that you want to print with each completed ticket. Choose a background Color for that specific scale-head to make sure the correct scale is being used to complete and print tickets. Click save to complete these changes. Customer Short List Under Application Configuration>Customer Short list Shows a list of all customers in the scale database in alphabetical order. Checking the Box next to a customer will put that customer into the drop-down list on all the scale ticket types in order to reduce load times because not all customers will be loading in the customer account drop-down. To add a customer to the short list manually, check the box next to their name, and click submit on the bottom left corner of the page. Gross Quantity Settings Under Application Configuration>Gross Quantity Settings Manually set up in scale to show the gross quantity conversions of certain products, i.e. lbs to gallons. To create a new gross quantity for a product: 1. Click create new on the top left of the page under INDEX 2. Choose the item ID for the correct item you want to add a quantity to 3. In Factor, enter the correct number. If you were to say a gallon of product is equal to 8 pounds, you would enter 8. The conversion is lbs/Unit of measure. The units of measure come from your FO system. 4. Choose your Commodity Unit of Measure. 5. Click Create. To edit a previously created Gross quantity, click Edit next to the GQ that you want to change and when you have finished editing it, click the blue \"Edit\" button to save it. To delete a previously created GQ, click delete next to the GQ. Confirm the delete by clicking the red \"Delete\" button.","title":"Scale Settings Configuration"},{"location":"scale-settings-configuration/#scale-settings-configuration","text":"","title":"Scale Settings Configuration"},{"location":"scale-settings-configuration/#settings","text":"Under Application Configuration>Settings - Site: Choose a site from the drop down to assign site ID to the scale app - Number Prefix: Enter in the number ID of the Site in FO - Scale: Leave as default value of 1 - Company Name: Enter company name - Company Location/Address: Enter in correct company address - Company Carrier: Use this to Select the transport that is set up in F&O to trasnport Transfer Tickets: Company Name - Logo: Click on this to choose a picture file: Sizing IS being updated for logo - Printer Server: Address of the Printer Server, Default value is http://localhost:8081 - Printer Service: Address of the Printer Service, Default value is: http://localhost:4343/printerservice - Report File Location: Location of where PDF versions of tickets are stored.
