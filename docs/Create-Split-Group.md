# Create a New Split Group

## Steps

Split Group Setup:
  - In Accounts Receivable > Customers > All customers > Select a customer and under the “Agriculture” tab
  - Click on "Split groups" under "Operation Management"
  - The Split Group screen will show the specific split groups associated to the customer. 
      - There is no limit to the number of split groups that can be created per customer. 
      - A specific split group can be set to active or inactive when it is no longer needed.
  - After a split group is created and made active, it can be selected for use on sales agreements and sales orders. Prepayments are applied against a sales invoice according to the split selected on the sales order.
