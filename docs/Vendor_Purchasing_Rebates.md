# Vendor Purchasing Rebates
Levridge has expanded vendor rebate to include the option to evaluate the line breaks retroactively and base the rebate on the total lifetime value. 

## Vendor Rebate Group
A link has been added to the vendor for access to the vendor rebate table. This will allow the user to select the vendor rebate groups that need to be associated with that vendor.

The vendor rebate group now includes a ‘Vendor Selection’ option that shows all vendors assigned to the selected vendor item rebate group. Vendors may be added or removed from the group.

## Item Rebate Group
A link has been added to the item release for access to the item rebate table. This will allow the user to select the item rebate groups that need to be associated with that item.

The item rebate group now includes an ‘Item Selection’ option to show all products assigned to the selected vendor item rebate group. Products may be added or removed from the group.  Product dimensions may also be displayed. 

## Rebate Agreement
The rebate agreement defines parameters that trigger the cumulation of rebates. The agreement parameters include:

- Switch to allow retroactive rebate based on a lifetime of cumulative purchases.

Upon creation of a vendor rebate agreement, the default expiry date of never has been changed to one year following the start date. The user has the option to update the expiry date.

## Rebate Process
Once the rebate agreements are setup up properly, every time a Purchase order is invoiced, the rebate will show up in the accrual account as well as in the Rebate claims screen.  

A rebate claims screen will provide details of rebates processed.  Processing from the claims will create a credit on the vendors account that can be left as a credit or settled against an invoice.
