## Managing Fertilizer Contracts for Ag Retailers

When fertilizer is contracted, a large quantity of product is being shipped and needs to be managed by the ag retailer, which is a big undertaking. Currently, most ag retailers are using an Access database to manage hundreds or thousands of lines of information without any ability to easily integrate that data to their financial system or pull reports of outstanding accounts or inventory levels.

With Levridge, the purchase, inventory, and distribution of fertilizers is all managed within one system, giving real-time information and data to users across different departments. Levridge allows users to access and record information on contracts, terminals, quantities, descriptions, and release numbers all on one screen. This information then integrates directly to the back office for invoicing, tracking, and inventory management.

Because Levridge is built on Dynamics 365, a Microsoft platform, it also integrates with Excel and allows user to export and import data on spreadsheets as well. This effectively eliminates all need for manual re-entry between systems or solutions.

Once a contract for fertilizer has been confirmed, the ag retailer can track and manage all loads within that contract which includes the load location, distribution site, shipping carrier, and delivery terms.

The purchase agreements remain in the system until the load is ready to be released. At that time, the individual line item then generates a purchase order which lists the details of the load and fulfills the order within the system.
