# Environment Planning
A standard D365 implementation is used when launching a Levridge environment plan. The standard D365 implementation guidelines are captured in the Stoneridge Software [Asset Library](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/tab%3A%3A65b5d435-4201-42ef-8a5b-cd0720466fbd/General?threadId=19%3A94c20c3705b444129e55850b80f0ea8e%40thread.skype&ctx=channel). 

## Overview
D365 is set up with Levridge sitting on top of the functionality. With the start of a new project, the team performs a technical review of what is required and outlines a plan that fits the client’s needs. The team utilizes the latest [Microsoft Environment planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning) when implementing a new project due to information continually being revised and updated. The Microsoft Environment planning provides an overview of various aspects that you must consider while you plan for your project's environment. 

To help guarantee a successful cloud implementation, it is important that you discuss and plan your environment early in the project.
