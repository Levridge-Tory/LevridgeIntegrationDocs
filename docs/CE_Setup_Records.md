# CE Setup Recrods
Initial CE setup records can be created multiple ways depending on client requirements. They can be set up through the integration, manually created in CE, or imported with tools.

Entities in pink must be set up in CE.

Entities in yellow will integrate over from FinOps.

Once item categories have been either created or 
imported in, the filtered xmls on the Plans and 
Batch Plans will need to be updated to reflect the 
item category GUIDs within your environment.  
 
- The Proposal OOB Proposal line Subgrids will also require filter updates to reflect the Item Category's in your environment.
