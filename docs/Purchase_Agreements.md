# Purchase Agreements
Agriculture retailers will contract with vendors to purchase a quantity of inventory over a specific period. When the contract is approved the vendor will send a list of all the releases that will be delivered over the contracted time. For example, the purchase of a large quantity of fertilizer from Koch will need to be managed in releases to track all delivery and payment data. To simplify the management of these contracts and released purchase orders we will need to have the following functionality.

1. Store release order information in a table that is on a purchase agreement. This information is displayed in a new screen ‘Purchase Agreement Release’. Each purchase agreement will store all the load numbers given to the ag retailer from the supplier for the duration of the agreement. Managing release loads becomes more efficient with access to a list of outstanding commitments. A user may highlight a line or load number from the below table and create a purchase order and direct delivery sales order.

See vendor reference on top screen that represents the vendor load number.
    - Review all purchase orders and all sales orders related to the purchase agreement
    - Assign an estimated freight value for Fertilizer Daily Position Report (DPR)

2. The above Purchase Agreement Release view may be filtered for use by a logistics expert. They may see lines that don’t have delivery address or carrier assignments.  

This allows them to:

   - Assign pickup address and delivery address
   - Assign carriers
   - Release and auto confirm a PO from a purchase agreement release line

3. Upon release of the PO a TMS load number is created. A carrier is also assigned on the line for auto invoicing.

4. After PO receiving, a user will review the loads, verify the data and post the receiving load.  

New functionality has been added to the process to:

   - Link a prepayment to the purchase agreement that will be surfaced on subsequent released purchased orders.
   - Levridge has enhanced TMS functionality to link a sales order to a release purchase order that will direct ship to the customer.
