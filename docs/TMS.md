Commodity accounting > Inbound > Delivery

Delivery Process on in-bound grain includes:

- Inbound scale tickets
- Delivery sheets
- Inbound scale ticket application
- Unit trains

### Inbound Scale Tickets

Commodity accounting > Inbound > Delivery > Inbound scale tickets

Most of the inbound scale tickets will be imported in from scale a scale interface. But you do have the ability to add new scale tickets or edit existing scale tickets that have been imported. 

To create a new scale ticket, click on New. 

A Create scale ticket window will appear on the right-hand side.  

- Ticket type
- Commodity
- Branch
- Warehouse
- Customer account
- Name
- Ticket date: this is a user field and can be overridden 
- Customer operation: There can be multiple operations for a customer. Must choose one.  A customer operation is required.

- Split Group: Will default in with the customer operation. This can be overridden. 

Click Create. 

The below image shows a newly created inbound scale ticket.

Additional information and categories one can enter attached to a scale ticket. 

- Scale ticket split details: If there were multiple splits, the system would preview the split they would be receiving. 
- Weights: The system calculates net weight. This is a toggle on/off button (defaults Driver to on). The user can select scale operation and grader if they want the information recorded on the ticket. 
- Date/Time: Can be viewed on the printed ticket. 
- Notes: There are two types of notes: External and Internal. External will print on scale ticket. 
- Grade factors: Grade factors are set up in the system and assigned to the commodity. The sequence they show up in the table is user defined. There is the ability for the moisture and test weight depending on equipment person has but can import moisture and test weight (TW). 
- User can enter other discount factors as well. Those are used to defer back to the discount schedules that are attached to any contract or storage agreement user has and calculate any premium or charges that are due based off those discounts. 
- Transportation Details: This is not a required entry but can be provided. It is a way to identify the driver delivering the commodity for informational purposes and when the truck comes back empty. 
- The Unit number is primary used in rail shipments can add and group this ticket with others. Sometimes previously hauled commodity is a required field so that there wasn’t hazardous material hauled prior to commodity. 

The next step is to Post to Inventory so all commodity received will show up in inventory to track and update DPR for inventory amounts. 

DPR: daily position report.

After the ticket is posted, it is locked in and ready to be used in other parts of the system. This concludes the inbound scale ticket option. 

### Inbound scale ticket application process

The Inbound scale ticket application process takes scale tickets received and provides the user the option to determine how the scale tickets will be used. 

  ![Picture7](.\assets\images\Grain_Inbound\Picture7.png)

- The contract number can be changed. 
- Inbound scale ticket auto-apply:
    - The user can set up a sequence in the system to auto apply on each contract. e.g. If you have it set up to sequence if you want your first application contract, second agreement storage agreement. The system will automatically apply your scale ticket or a portion of it to an existing purchase contract or to an existing storage agreement based on the sequences set up on your auto-apply functionality. 
    - Inbound scale ticket un-apply
        - Ability to unassign scale tickets from contracts
        - Can select a scale ticket not previously assigned to a contract (if let’s say it was un-applied as mentioned above) the user can click on the scale ticket and allocate it to a purchase contract or a storage agreement. Or you can do the full amount or part of a contract. 

This is what the inbound scale ticket application program will do to get commodities moved to the specific obligations a customer may have.  

### Delivery Sheets 

Delivery Sheets is a way to group multiple tickets together for same commodity and same customer. You can also use delivery sheet to calculate average grades. It is a delivery sheet to group tickets together and process them as a group instead of individually. 

  ![Picture8](.\assets\images\Grain_Inbound\Picture8.png)
