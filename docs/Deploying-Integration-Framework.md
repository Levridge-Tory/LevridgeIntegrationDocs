## Deploying the Integration Framework
There are several ways to deploy the integration framework. Since the framework is a
standard [Azure Application Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/)
we can use any of the deployment options available. The simplest deployment is to [deploy
a zip file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-zip).

Select one of the following options for more information on Deploying to Azure:


 - [Deploy as Zip file](./Deploy-Integration-Framework-as-Zip-File.md)
 - Deploy via FTP
 - Deploy with Script

The Integration Framework can also be [deployed as a Windows Service](Deploy-Integration-As-A-Service.md).
