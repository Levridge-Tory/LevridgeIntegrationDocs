# Introduction
The Levridge Integration Framework uses the CDS repository to store reference data.
We need to provide deployment packages that include solutions, applications and data
that can be used to deploy the CDS components to the customer.

This document explains the steps necessary to package CDS for deployment to a customer environment.

# Overview
The steps necessary to prepare the CDS components for deployment are:
1. Create the Solution
2. Create the application packages
3. Create the export schemas
4. Export the data
5. Check assets into source control
