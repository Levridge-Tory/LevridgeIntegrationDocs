# Print Configuration Notes
### Installing Print Service Application
To first install print service application, open Visual Studio.
In Visual Studio, the print service is checked-in at "$/Levridge/CRM/Main/PrintService".

Double click this and map it to a path on your machine.

In Visual Studio click Build > Build Solution.
Activate the service as detailed below in PowerShell:

- Right click on the windows icon and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)"

- Enter the following command once. Be sure to substitute the local path!
    
>     New-Service-Name"PrintService"-"{Your Local path to project}\PrintService\bin\Debug\PrintService.exe-k netsvcs"
 
### Locating Printer Network Name
If a printer is a network device, its name will be more difficult to locate.
Use these steps to find the name that
the Print Service application will use to print:

1. Go to control panel and locate the setting titled "Devices and Printers"
(Note: Not all setting are in this screenshot. This view is set to "Small icons")

>     Start-Service-Name"PrintService"

**Services App.**

### Setting Up a New Printer

To set up a new printer, new parameters will need to be setup. To add the parameters, open the app.config file in the project and add the following:

- ServiceBusConnectionString
- ServiceBusTopicSubscription
- ServiceBusTopic
- PrinterName
- SiteID

Two parameters will also need to be updated.
These two need to be changed for the printer that is being printed to.
The Site ID is the customer site code from CRM.

For debugging the Service, we can use the Windows Event Viewer. Go to Administrative tools in the Control Panel and Open Event Viewer.

### Additional Information and Documentation

In CRM on the sales ordered details header, there is an Auto Print Field. Set to Yes and click save. The sales order will then print. 
 

# Configuration Setup CRM
To begin configuration setup in CRM, first import LevCore Solution followed by importing
Agronomy Solution.

Migrate the ESG Configuration data using the Configuration Migration Tool.
   - This tool can be downloaded at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/download-tools-nuget

Ensure an Application User has been created with admin security roles assigned.

If integrating records from CRM to AX, you will need to create steps on the service endpoint using the Plugin Registration tool.

Steps will also need to be created on plugins which require the pricing service. The configuration will look like this:
```
   {
     "clientappid": "da7c3de3-5555-49ab-8465-d01e8cd22e58",
     "clientappsecret": "dradgg38ddszLzgqbcZ3/8sG2FbC/BSWxnCtXzJsWP8=",
     "tenant": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/5555a5b1-fbt8-465b-ad9d-21e21129e610/oauth2/token",
     "uristring": "https://environment22c2251c662a7e541devaos.cloudax.dynamics.com/api/services/LevPricingServices/PricingService/getPricing",
     "resource": "https:// environment22c2251c662a7e541devaos.cloudax.dynamics.com",
     "username": "John.smith@email.com",
     "password": "plaintextpassword"
   }
```

Setup the data through integrations, create it in CRM, or import data packets.

Once item categories have been either created or imported in, the filtered xmls on the Plans and Batch Plans will need to be updated to reflect the item category GUIDs within 
your environment.
 
- The Proposal OOB Proposal line Subgrids will also require filter updates to reflect the Item Category's in your environment.
