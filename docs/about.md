Use these steps to find the name that
the Print Service application will use to print:

1. Go to control panel and locate the setting titled "Devices and Printers"

### Setting Up a New Printer

To set up a new printer, new parameters will need to be setup. To add the parameters, open the app.config file in the project and add the following:

- ServiceBusConnectionString
- ServiceBusTopicSubscription
- ServiceBusTopic
- PrinterName
- SiteID

Two parameters will also need to be updated.
These are the printer name and the SiteID.
These two need to be changed for the printer that is being printed to.
The Site ID is the customer site code from CRM.
