# Managing Splits, Sales Contracts, and Prepayments

## Overview
Within Levridge, when a sales order or invoice is created, the system automatically selects the sales contract according to the items and categories identified. It also selects a prepayment against it, eliminating the need to manually go in and figure out the process, creating fewer invoicing issues sent to growers. 

Target Audience: This functionality applies to individuals in Ag Retailers who manage splits, contracts, and prepayments on behalf of customers.
