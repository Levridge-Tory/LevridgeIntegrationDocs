The [CRM End-to-End Scenarios](CRM-End-To-End-Scenarios.md) and Processes provides an overview of the following information: 
1. Planned to Sales Agreement – sales tool within CRM used to price product and transition growers into contracts. 
2. Fertilizer Calculator – utility that allows a salesman to determine and calculate fertilizer requirements such as what product best fits the need of the customer and how much of that product is needed to fulfill the order (some work is still needed and is anticipated to be ready in Fall of 2020). 
3. Sales Order Process – integration of all Levridge pieces, specifically split billing, and its close integration with sales orders in FinOps.
