### Printer Settings
 
Under Application Configuration>Printer Settings.

This window is used to choose the correct printers for each of your scale heads at a location, and to choose a corresponding menu color to know which scale head you are working with in your window. The printer settings you choose in this window will then default in when you choose that scale on the Application start page. 

**Note:** This setup is required. The printer selection can be changed to any printer on the Start page, but default printer setup is required to be able to print scale tickets. 

#### To Set up the Printer Settings for a Scale: 
1. Choose the scale you want to set up from the drop down on the top of the page. 
2. Choose your printers for both your Tickets and BOL.
3. Using the printer Type can change between a full page printout vs. a receipt printout. 
4. Choose the number of copies that you want to print with each completed ticket.
5. Choose a background Color for that specific scale-head to make sure the correct scale is being used to complete and print tickets. 
6. Click save to complete these changes. 

### Customer Short List

Shows a list of all customers in the scale database in alphabetical order. Checking the Box next to a customer will put that customer into the drop-down list on all the scale ticket types in order to reduce load times because not all customers will be loading in the customer account drop-down. 

1. To add a customer to the short list manually, check the box next to their name, and click submit on the bottom left corner of the page.
