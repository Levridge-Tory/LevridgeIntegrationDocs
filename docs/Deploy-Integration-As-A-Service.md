# Introduction
This webhost application can be run in three modes:

* As a web application (in Azure or IIS)
* As a console application
* As a service

## Run as a service
To run as a service it must be installed. To install as a service you must get the code
and place it in the folder from which you want the service to run. The simplest way
to get the code is to get the zip file from the latest build. [Here are some instructsion
for getting the latest code.](./Deploy-Integration-Framework-as-Zip-File.md)
Get the zip file and unzip it into the folder from which you want the service to run.

Deployed with the code should bethree powershell scripts:

* InstallService.ps1 - this script will install the service
* InstallEventSource.ps1 - this script will install an event source on the Application EventLog on the local machine
* RemoveService.ps1 - this script will uninstall / remove the service

### InstallService.ps1
This script installs a service and sets it to automatically run on startup. 
It accepts the following command line parameters:

- PublishPath - the path to the folder from which you want the service to run
- ServiceUser - user account under which the service will run (default = $env:computername+"\IntegrationHost")
- ServiceName - the name of the service (default = "Levridge.Integration.Host")
- ServiceDescription - the description for the service (default = "Levridge Integration Host Service")
- ServiceDisplayName - the display name for the service (default = "Levridge Integration Host")
- SourceName - the source name under which EventLog entries should be logged (default = $ServiceName)

This script will also execute the InstallEventSource.ps1 

### InstallEventSource.ps1

## Command line parameters
This application can be run with the following command line parameters:

  services or web applications.
- service (-s) - This will cause the application to run as a service 
  (if the debugger is not attached). 
- SourceName (sn) - This will cause the application to use the specified source name
