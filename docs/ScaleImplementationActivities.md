# Scale Implementation Activities

## Overview
The following is an overview of the implementation activities necessary for getting started with scale.  

### Full Implementation - Includes Integration to FinOps
At the scale:
1.	Install the [scale application](how-to-install-levridge-scale.md)
2.	Setup Azure service bus 
3.	Configure the Azure service bus to connect to FinOps
    - Setup event endpoint in FinOps
4.	Configure the [appsettings.json](appsettings.json.md) files for the scale application
5.	Connect [hardware](ScaleHeadHardwareSetup.md) to the application
6.	Configure the scale application settings
    - Customer short list
    - Gross quantity settings
    - Printer settings
    - Equipment mgmt
    - Main settings page
### In FinOps
1.	Set up the event framework events for integrating to the scale
2.	Configure data that will be sent back-and-forth to the scale (requires input from client on how they want to use the scale)
    - Products
      - Carrier services
      - Use in scale flag
      - Net weight
      - Units of measure
      - Create estimated ticket flag
      - Use TMS parameters
    - Scale operators from the workers table
    - Rolling stock
      - Equipment types and container weights (if using estimated tickets)
    - Grade factors
    - Grade factor sequencing
    - Growing seasons
    - Hazardous materials
    - Freight carriers
    - Customers
    - Customer split groups
    - Customer operations and sites
    - Units of measure
    - Inventory sites
    - Pits
    - Bins
3.	Setup number sequences
4.	Setup scale parameters under AR > Setup > Ag > Ag parameters
    - All scale tickets
    - Agronomy scale
5.	Configure batch processes for generating orders from tickets (sales orders, transfer orders, etc.)
6.	Configure TMS (requires input from the client on how they want to configure)
    - Delivery terms
    - Shipping carriers
      - Grower and company
    - Carrier services
    - TMS parameters under TMS > Setup > TMS parameters > General > Agronomy scale
      - Default settings for grower and company carriers
    - Rating and routing
7.	Synch initial data to the scale prior to running
