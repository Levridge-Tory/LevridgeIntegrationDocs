# Levridge Scale Overview

The purpose of Levridge Scale is to receive all the data measured at the scales at ag retailer locations and incorporate it into a scale ticket
which can be printed out and given to the grower, while also bringing the scale ticket into the Dynamics 365 ERP system. 
Within the accounting technology solution, the contents of the scale ticket can be accounted for and posted against contracts the grower has with the ag retailer.
